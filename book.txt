Just Another Layer of Complicated Subsidies
I am a very lucky man. I live where I want to live in the middle of what I think is
the most beautiful county in England. This is an opinion that is shared by many
farmers in all parts of the country. We value the landscape that surrounds us,
the fields, the woods, the hedges and trees, a patchwork view that has evolved
over many centuries. It is not a contrived landscape like a garden or park, nor
is its beauty due to any foresight on our part. It is the result of trying to farm
profitably, to make the best use of every acre. And for me the pleasure in that
landscape does depend to a great extent on how well the land is farmed. I see
nothing very beautiful in a neglected farm, better if it were not farmed at all,
but allowed to revert to nature.
Now suddenly, something that has had an inherent value for all of us, town
and country folk alike, has got to have an actual value placed on it. I refer to
the ‘broad and shallow’ stewardship scheme as envisaged by the Curry Report.
By modulating (‘Ministry speak’ for reducing) our subsidy cheques, money will
be available to pay us for cherishing (my word, the Ministry don’t know that
one) the environment. We will be able to claim for the work that keeps the
countryside looking as beautiful as it has always done, or better still, as it used
to do, and maintains or increases the wonderful variety of plant and wildlife
associated with it. Of course it is not as simple as that. It would need a
Solomon to even contemplate such a scheme. How do you reward farmers fairly
in counties as varied as Norfolk and Northumberland? If we are all to be
modulated we should all be able to access any scheme equally. A suckler cow
gets the same payment in Devon as in Essex. And who will decide what a
landscape should look like? Or whether one barn owl is better than ten yellow
hammers? No doubt something will be thrashed out behind committee room
13

2002
doors and we’ll start calculating how we can work the resulting scheme to our
best individual advantage.
And so it goes on, another layer of complicated subsidies. The ink is scarcely
dry on Curry than our old friend Fischler, in the dying moments of his farm
commission days, comes up with the idea of a single payment based on the past
subsidies of each farm. God help us! What about the future and the young
farmers coming in? Will they have to look for a farm with a good subsidy
record? Perhaps it is not the young farmers that Fischler is concerned with,
but the new entrants to the European Community, with no subsidy record at
all. If you are not a farmer reading this, I have probably lost you already. I
am pretty good at making simple things seem complicated; it takes years of
practice filling in Ministry forms.
What we do not need are any more fancy schemes. We already have ‘Sites
of Special Scientific Interest’, ‘Environmentally Sensitive Areas’ and a ‘Stewardship Scheme’ that between them are quite capable of delivering the varied
countryside that the public want. Put more money into them, pay for the access, the footpaths and the wildlife habitats that farming provides. And pay
a decent amount so that those of us who look after these aspects can make a
proper living. If agriculture needs support, let’s make it simple so that everyone
can understand it. Why not an annual payment for every acre farmed, one rate
for enclosed land and another for open land? We already have quite enough
constraints on how we farm. If we want to modulate against the larger farms,
and I would be in favour of doing so, use the number of people involved and
employed as the yardstick for adjustment. The economists will say that is penalising efficiency, but so what? It is people we are talking about supporting
and we need more people working in the rural areas, not just living there.
And finally, if I may use as a metaphor the biblical story of Joseph and
the fat and thin cows, let us hope that the politicians don’t spend too much
time tinkering with the Technicolour dream coat, but concentrate a little more
on the message it contained. Years of plenty can easily be followed by years
of shortage. With global warming and nuclear terrorism, who knows what the
future holds.

Enough Basic Food Must Be Available for Poorest

July 31st
Enough Basic Food Must Be Available for Poorest
I watched the opening of the Commonwealth Games on television last week.
The children of Manchester danced in the arena, David Beckham helped a little
six-year-old girl, with a terminal heart condition and attached permanently to
an oxygen cylinder, hand the Jubilee Baton to the Queen. A million pound
fireworks display lit up the night sky. The late news followed. The first item
showed pictures of the latest drought disaster to hit southern Africa, fourteen
million people facing starvation, half of them children. Pictures of little six-yearolds with swollen stomachs and skeletal frames who will certainly die before help
can come. Shots of empty grain stores following three years of no rain. I know
the two sets of images cannot be taken together to put things right, life is not
that simple. There are many other factors involved, HIV Aids, war and political
instability. But as June Whitfield, one of the celebrities launching the appeal for
emergency aid the next morning, is reported to have said ‘it is quite incredible
that the public should be asked again to help’. And she is quite right. This is
not an unexpected disaster like an earthquake, forest fire or tidal wave. This is
Africa where droughts happen all the time.
As a farmer, I can clearly recall the ’76 drought in the South West, with the
grass fields turning to coconut matting, and yields of three hundredweight per
acre and virtually no straw from spring barley. That was after one dry summer,
with little rain for six months. I try to imagine a situation here with no rain
for three years. And I have to ask why those grain stores in Africa were allowed
to become empty? Why is the Disasters Emergency Committee appealing for
help now so late? There is no shortage of grain in the world. Our own national
harvest just starting looks to be a bumper one and yet we are concerned for
the grain market by the overhang of surpluses from the US and the Black Sea
countries.
And then the next evening I find myself pushing a trolley round our local
Supermarket. The shelves are stacked with food from every part of the world.
There is no space empty, nothing is out of stock. And pictures of those African
children inevitably come into my mind. What happens to the food that is not
sold, that goes past it’s ‘sell by’ or ‘display until’ date? Do the staff buy it cheap,
as I know they used to. Pig swill is now outlawed thanks to a Northumbrian
farmer, who should never have been keeping pigs, but can farmers still buy the
unsold vegetables for stock feed? I look for the manager and get the answer I am
expecting. Company policy, everything past its date goes into the skip. Fresh
today, land-fill tomorrow. As the song says, ‘what a difference a day makes’.
15

2002
And again I know that this is not the answer to feeding the millions who would
be appalled to see such waste. But surely we can do better, there must be ways
of using this food here. Or is it the recently appointed Food Standards Agency
that is enforcing rigid rules?
Earlier last week it was reported that Lord Haskins, chairman of Northern
Foods and advisor to Tony Blair, has urged farmers to concentrate on markets
that are large and real. I take that to mean we must produce food at world
prices, never mind the constraints of farming to our standards of animal and
environmental welfare. He tells us to be part of the global market, produce food
cheaply. I suppose that might ease his conscience about chucking the surplus
in a tip. Well, can I urge the Lord Haskins’ of this world to concentrate on
their responsibilities? If the multinational bosses and international money men
want the freedom to operate world wide, if they claim globalization is a way
of bringing prosperity to everyone, then they must take care to see that there
is enough basic food and medicine available for the poorest among us. They
must not rely on last minute appeals to public charity when tragedy strikes.
Otherwise their motives may be seen as self-seeking and hypocritical.

August 7th
A Case for Conventional Farming
When news that the Government was going to invest millions in the future of
organic farming hit the headlines last week, my first reaction was ‘good for
them’. However, as I read on, I began to be alarmed by some of the extraordinary statements appearing in the press about what I would call ‘conventional
farming’. And not only the national press, who love a good story if they can
hype it up. Our regional press, including I am sorry to say, the Western Morning News, were making the most outrageous slurs about modern farming. Our
editorial that first morning said that organic farming was a reversion to ‘good
husbandry after years of exploitative pillaging of land and abuse of livestock
which led to mass-poisoning of the land and the populace’. And the paper’s
main article the following morning by food correspondent, Mark Daniel, used
phrases such as ‘the pursuit of cheapness at any cost has cost the health of
billions and the lives of millions’ and ‘local, fresh, organically produced food
and drink taste 100 times better than the muck which is produced regardless of
provenance and good practice’.
Now, come on. I, and a great many farmers like me, are not about to have
the way we farm rubbished like this. Perhaps Mark Daniel might excuse himself
by suggesting he was merely indulging in hyperbole. But this goes way beyond
16

Aug 7th

A Case for Conventional Farming

exaggeration. This is a load of twaddle. We have doubled food production in
the last 50 years to feed the nation, at, I thought, the nation’s request. Where
are the billions ill and millions dead that Mark Daniel talks about? Where is
the evidence of mass-poisoning of land and people? It only takes three years
to convert non-organically farmed land to organic status. A remarkably quick
recovery for poisoned land.
And the lives of millions - what millions? If this a reference to BSE, TB
or Foot and Mouth, organically farmed animals are no more immune to these
diseases than any other animals. Any damage we might have done to people’s
health is more likely by producing food so cheaply that we have encouraged
obesity. The vast majority of us farm under an assurance scheme of one sort
or another, organic status is just such another. As we all know, the essential
difference is the prohibition of synthetic pesticides and soluble fertilisers. The
remaining rules are just standards of good husbandry which all of us aspire to.
Some of us are better at it than others. We have some bad apples and some
shining examples of good practice among non-organic farmers. Farming is not
black and white, as has been implied, but like everything in life, it is all shades
of grey.
I am not opposed to organic farming. I started my career with three years
studying the science and theory of agriculture under some very eminent professors, leaving with letters after my name in the hope of getting a well paid job.
Why I ended up as a farmer is another story. But nothing led me to believe
that the correct use of fertilisers and pesticides was inherently harmful. Used in
excess, yes, but most things used in excess are harmful. An excess of ‘organic’
farming may harm our ability to feed ourselves.
We have friends and neighbours who farm organically. I respect their views
and have always been open to conversion. In the early 60’s we had an interesting
family buy the small farm adjoining us, farming organically and producing the
most outstanding tasting vegetables. Not a 100 times better, but certainly the
best I have ever tasted. They were committed vegans, which made going to
supper quite an event. It also made asking them back even more of an event.
Geoff, who took me to Soil Association meetings and introduced me to some of
the leading lights at that time of the ‘organic’ movement, reckoned that the taste
of his vegetables was due to the extensive use he made of seaweed fertiliser. I
believe that is now banned under organic rules. The family left after a few years
and emigrated to Australia. We were sorry to see them go although there were
some compensations. The farm was bought by an airline pilot, who converted
half the land into an airstrip and, in exchange for a regular supply of milk,
gave me free flying lessons and the family free flights. We were also able to buy
17

2002
the other half of the farm, which he didn’t need, at a ridiculously low price.
We put all the land into permanent pasture, but I was very surprised at the
serious infestation of docks and ragwort that it produced in the first few years.
The docks we put up with, but the ragwort got on top of us and eventually
we sprayed it with a weed killer. It is the only time I have used a herbicide
on grass land in 50 years of farming. I didn’t blame organic farming for the
problem; I think the fault lay in the excessive use Geoff made of a rotovator as
a cultivating tool, instead of ploughing. A pity he didn’t uses horses - but then
he was a vegan.
We buy our vegetables now from a well known local organic farm. The real
difference to supermarket veg is the freshness. I might be quite pleased if Phil
and Helen decided not to work so hard, deserted their principles and used a
little fertiliser and spray occasionally. After all, if they are growing varieties
that are resistant to pests and diseases, what are we eating. To be resistant
involves plants producing chemicals that are poisonous to the insects or disease
they are being challenged by.
I feel as strongly about organic versus conventional farming when it comes
to the environment, but that will have to wait for another time.

August 14th
Harvesting Was Much More Fun 200 Years Ago
We are half way through our harvest; 16 acres of barley done with 14 acres of
oats to come. As I write, the rain is gently falling and I should be doing our
Suckler Cow Premium application for this year. The harvest is nothing like the
worry it used to be when we started farming. Then the corn was cut with a
binder and left in stooks for two or three weeks. It needed another spell of dry
weather to get it into a stack and was still a long way from being thrashed.
Now the contractor rolls in with the combine, which seems to get bigger every
year, and four hours later 16 acres of barley is in the corn bin. We used to make
sure the gateways were wide enough but now the concern is whether the field
is wide enough. We still have some two or three acre fields, but I doubt they
will ever grow corn again.
The other day, I was reading an account of harvesting 200 years ago. It
was in ‘General view of the Agriculture of the County of Devon’, written by
Charles Vancouver in 1806. To paraphrase, it seems that when 10 to 20 acres
of corn was ripe, notice was given in the neighbourhood that a reaping was to
be performed on a particular day. A gang of an indefinite number of men and
women assembled and, after a breakfast lasting till 9 o’clock, work started. By
18

Aug 14th

Harvesting Was Much More Fun 200 Years Ago

11 or 12 o’clock, the cider had so warmed their spirits that the resulting revelry
helped to attract more hands.
At one o’clock, dinner consisting of the best meat and vegetables, was carried
into the field and distributed with copious draughts of ale and cider. Work
went on from two till five ‘without other interruption than the squabbles of the
party’, when ‘drinkings’ were taken with buns, cakes and ‘all such articles as
the confectionery skill of the farmer’s wife could produce’. After ‘drinkings’
(reminds me of a cricket match), the field was finished amid considerable noise
and tumult, when the company retired to the farmhouse to ‘sup, carouse and
vociferate until one or two in the morning’. The whole thing was repeated the
next day at the next farm and so on through harvest time.
Not surprisingly, no wages were paid, but the workers were invited to a
‘harvest frolic’, and at Christmas there was open house, which seldom continued
less than four days and nights when the behaviour of the guests could be likened
to the antics of a bear-garden. This must have been a considerable expense to
the farmer and the authorities were not happy at the disorderly nature of the
proceedings, but I suppose wheat was making a good price. It was around the
time of the Battle of Trafalgar and we were having a little local difficulty with
the French. Nothing changes !
Back to the Suckler Cow form. This is not a job I have been looking forward
to as the penalties for mistakes get heavier every year, but is something beef
farmers can not ignore. The premium is a very large part of our annual income.
We used to have a young Ministry official (generally female) walk round the farm
with a pair of binoculars to check the eartags of the animals we had applied for.
I was quite happy to accompany them. Foot and Mouth put an end to that.
Last year, unbeknownst to us, applications had to match exactly the records
held on the passport office computer in Cumbria. Or you were in trouble.
We were informed in February that a mistake had been found on our application. I phoned Cumbria and was told that one of the heifers on our claim was,
according to their computer, a cow. There was a two-year old calf somewhere
in the country which claimed our heifer as it’s dam. I pointed out that our
heifer would have been one month old when it’s calf was born; this was not
merely miraculous, it was impossible. Not to worry, I was told, all would be
corrected in due course. Doubtless when I put the phone down, the computer
their end got a good thumping for allowing itself to be wrongly programmed.
It did not even matter if the animal was a cow or a heifer, the premium claimed
was exactly the same.
Come the end of May, I rang DEFRA to see if all was in order - the Suckler
Premium was already overdue. We needed the money. Nothing doing. At the
19

2002
end of June, with July 1st the Commission deadline for payments to be paid, I
wrote to Whitehall and was promised a reply from the Rural Payments Agency.
Four weeks later, no reply. I wrote again, this time to the top civil servant at
DEFRA. He is on holiday but I will definitely get a reply by August 9th. Oh
yes? Nothing yet and I still don’t know if the mistake, DEFRA’s mistake, has
been corrected.
It is a desperate situation. Three quarters of the farmers in the South West
who are owed Suckler Premiums for last year are unpaid. I understand that
staff at the RPA in Exeter are working their socks off to get things sorted.
Meanwhile DEFRA is accumulating fines of millions of pounds of taxpayers
money for missing the deadline.
And our debts are building up as the months go by. We will get the bill for
the combining soon. Perhaps we should offer our contractor an invite for four
days open house at Christmas.
To help me do this year’s Suckler Claim, I have just received a print out
from Cumbria of our animals currently listed on their computer. The only thing
is, it doesn’t show whether they are cows or heifers. Here we go again.

August 21st
Vaccinate Our Badgers Now
Over the years I have followed with interest, and sometimes with exasperation,
the correspondence in these pages on badgers and TB. I have never, until now,
felt inclined or perhaps dared is a better word, to join in. Are badgers to
blame for the regular recurrence of TB in cattle in the south west, or do cattle
occasionally infect the odd badger? The arguments from both sides have become
more and more extreme, and I have been reluctant to get caught in the middle.
But last week, a letter from one of the most frequent writers, Martin Hancox
of Stroud, has stung me into the debate. He states that ‘no one has shown how
badgers can give cows a respiratory lung infection in the field’. Well, I reckon I
can and quite easily.
If I had any doubts, one incident which happened about three years ago
convinced me. Badgers are a very common sight in our grass fields in the late
evening, rooting for worms in the spots where old cowpats have decomposed.
The field I was walking through had three badgers busy feeding and, as I had
a camera with me, I thought I would try and get a picture. I got to within
about a yard of one without disturbing it and bent down to get a close up, but
the badger still seemed unaware of me. In order to get it to look up, I nudged
it with my foot. The effect was immediate. The badger started back with its
20

Aug 21st

Vaccinate Our Badgers Now

hackles up and gave a sort of coughing bark straight at my face. I was close
enough to get spittle on my face. The badger ran off three or four yards before
returning to attack my wellington boot. We then both retired in disorder and
I never got my photograph. I have seen a badger do exactly the same when
approached by a dog. Cows grazing in a field with feeding badgers certainly
get the same treatment and their faces are nearer the badger than mine was. If
that badger had been a TB carrier, then I must have been at risk. I know of
no other British mammal that behaves in this way.
However, I don’t think this is the commonest route of infection from badger
to cow. As I am sure Mr Hancox knows, infected sputum from a badger’s lungs
can be swallowed and the bacillus pass intact through the gut, to be deposited in
the badger latrines that we find close to the hedgerows of many of our fields. The
bacillus will survive in the droppings far longer than it would as an aerosol. And,
as every farmer will agree, the first thing a bunch of calves or newly purchased
cattle will do on turnout is inspect the boundaries of the field, including sniffing
along these badger toilets. Of even more concern is the evidence, which I have
on very good authority, that older badgers have been shown to excrete TB in
the last two or three years of their life, having been infected as young animals
and recovered. I understand this happens in other species including man. The
problem for cattle is that these old badgers, generally boars, get turned out
of the colony by the dominant sow. They become wanderers, moving through
other colonies, looking for food where they can against younger opposition, and
ending up in cattle yards and feed passages with disastrous consequences.
Twenty years ago, we had an explosion in badger numbers, which I attributed on this farm to the growing of maize as a forage crop. We now have
over 15 badger sets within a mile of where I am writing; fifty years ago we had
four which were never all occupied at the same time. We have given up growing
maize and the badger population is noticeably declining. Much as we all enjoy
seeing them, their numbers were becoming ridiculous. They were having a serious effect on other wild life and, I suspect, each other. If we are unfortunate
enough to find TB in our cattle, and I am tempting fate as we have never yet
had a reactor, killing badgers would for me be the very last resort. Nor do
I agree with the argument often put by farmers that we are doing badgers a
favour by killing off the diseased ones. Badgers are extremely tough animals
and, if not stressed, can take TB in their stride.
What we urgently need are vaccines for both cattle and badgers, especially
badgers, to begin to eliminate the carriers. I understand Ireland is already well
down this route - why don’t we co-operate? Meanwhile the Krebs trial is a total
waste of time. It will result in huge expense, countless badgers killed to prove
21

2002
something we already know, and TB out of control while we wait. If society
wants to consider badgers as sacrosanct, payment for consequential loss will
have to be made.

August 28th
All Is Safely Gathered in
Last week saw our harvest completed, with the straw, which we value nearly as
much as the corn, safely baled and in the barn, and all before a bright harvest
moon reached full. We have had a good year so far. The summer has suited us,
with rain at regular intervals to keep our steeper pastures from burning and not
too much to interfere with silage and hay making. We have enough of everything
to face whatever the winter might throw at us, or am I tempting fate? What
a difference this is compared with last year, when we had too many animals
stuck on the farm, thanks to ‘foot and mouth’. We went into last winter with
about half our fodder requirements and ended up buying silage and straw in
the spring. I wonder how many people outside farming realise how long it takes
to get back to where we were 18 months ago, when the F&M horror all started.
And beef and sheep farming wasn’t going a bundle then. Meanwhile, the outside
world is worrying about global warming, a vast cloud of brown smog is hanging
over south east Asia poisoning millions, and the ‘great and good’ have gathered
in Johannesburg at the Earth Summit to talk about it all. Will it result in just
more hot air?
It reminds me of a hot air balloon ride I was lucky enough to win in a
raffle several years ago. There were seven of us, including my daughter Cath
and her partner David. Our pilot introduced himself as Arthur Street and I
said I believed him. It seemed a very good name to give to an irate geriatric
farmer like me, when making a landing in a bunch of stampeding cows. He
assured me he was actually the nephew of the late great A.G.Street, farmer
and author. We took off from ‘George’s Field’ in the middle of Exeter. It was
a fine, hazy late summer’s afternoon with little or no wind. We were hoping
to fly in the general direction of home, about seventeen miles north west, and
view the familiar country side from above. I always think how boring England
looks from an aeroplane. I suppose there is nowhere high enough to give any
perspective but perhaps floating along a few hundred feet above ground in a
basket might be better. We went up smoothly to a thousand feet but remained
directly above Exeter. Arthur said there should be a southerly wind if we tried
going higher. The ground slowly receded into the haze and at two thousand
feet we suddenly emerged into a clear blue sky with no sign of Exeter at all.
22

Sep 4th

When It Comes to Politics Take a French Lesson

Instead we were sitting on a platform of pavement coloured smog which looked
solid enough to walk on. Apparently this is quite normal in still weather over
any city and is the height at which the particulates of exhaust fumes settle out
of the atmosphere. Maybe I haven’t explained that strictly accurately, but the
sheer volume of filth we must be breathing every day in town can never be
better visualised.
Needless to say, we never did find any wind, and landed four miles away
in Upton Pyne. And not in the middle of a herd of cattle, but on the edge of
a cornfield. We came down so gently that the men in the party were able to
get out holding onto the basket and walk the balloon into a quiet country lane,
where we folded up the canopy and stole away with nothing to show that we
had ever been there. I was going on to write ‘how nice it is to breathe clean
country air’, but Jim, my son, has just come back from Eaglescott airfield in
North Devon, to say his flight in a microlite, a present from my daughter-in-law,
has been cancelled due to poor visibility in haze. It looks a fine August evening
from the ground. So even out here we can’t escape the pollution.
Are we as farmers contributing to the problem? Do our tractors throw out
more exhaust fumes than they used to? The answer has to be that they don’t.
Our tractors today are certainly bigger and more powerful than there were
in the past, but engine efficiency has improved enormously. With the larger
implements they handle, the time it takes to get through the various tilling and
harvesting operations has reduced out of all proportion. I only have to stand
on our hill and listen. I used to hear tractors droning on from every direction
on almost every day in the summer. Now silence is the norm with bursts of
activity from time to time. Most of the noise comes from those fuel guzzling
monsters in the sky.

September 4th
When It Comes to Politics Take a French Lesson
Last week saw our rams in with the ewe flock. This is very late for us; we have
for many years put the rams in soon after shearing with a view to catching
the early suck-lamb trade in late February or March. We are able to keep our
small flock of ewes and lambs outdoors through the winter on mowing grass,
without supplementary feeding unless it snows. This has given us the best
lamb price, does our light land good and takes the pressure off our silage and
hay acres in late spring early summer. However two things have persuaded my
daughter-in-law, who manages the sheep, to change the system. Firstly we are
still recovering from the mismanagement of the flock last year when we were
23

2002
forced to keep our lambs on the ewes until May or June. And more importantly,
the very good trade we used to get at Easter seems to have slipped in recent
years. The price we received for the last few lambs we sold in late May this
year was considerably better than the price we got in March. What caused this
I don’t know. Did the export trade to France restart at that time perhaps?
I am sometimes asked by non-farming friends why farmers export live lambs
for slaughter to France, instead of as carcasses. I tell them that we ourselves
never sell fat sheep, or cattle for that matter, other than direct to an abattoir,
the nearer the abattoir the better. That is because I have always preferred
deadweight marketing through a farmer co-operative. However, before I give
my friends an impression of being ‘holier than thou’, I do go on to make it
clear that our prices depend on the liveweight market price of the day. And
the French, who are our best customers, prefer to eat lamb that is slaughtered
close to home, their home. If the French are to be denied the right to buy lamb
through an agent at a British livestock market, the regulations on the transport
of live animals would need to be tightened up even more than they already are.
I also point out to my non-farming friends that all the farmers I know would
be delighted if animals destined for slaughter could go direct to the nearest
slaughter house, so long as we were guaranteed a fair price for what we produced.
Unfortunately we do not live in a perfect world, yet. However I have to admit to
having a sneaking admiration for the French farming community. They certainly
know how to make their Farm Ministers toe the line. And it is not just the fact
that French people as a whole are more rural minded, this is becoming less and
less relevant. When we have travelled in France by car on the rare holidays we
have managed in the past, we have made a point of staying at farm ‘bed and
breakfast’s. It has been amusing to see the reaction of the rather grumpy, and
often smelly, farmer to the news from his appeasing wife that the guests on this
occasion are also farmers. Out comes the Calvados and the dictionary and we
are discussing how to solve our respective problems until after midnight. The
only snag has been the inevitable tour of the farm the following morning, before
we can continue on our way.
And it is clear that they have as many ridiculous rules and regulations
imposed on them as we have. Our problem is that we do not seem able to get
our politicians, whether Labour or Conservative, to understand how to work the
system in Brussels. I have to take my hat off to them for keeping our beef out of
France for so long, never mind a fine they will never pay, and nearly managing
to keep our lamb out as well, (that would have sorted out live exports for the
animal rights lobby).

Ministers Have Proved to Be a Big Failure in Recent Years

I wonder how French farmers are viewing the proposed ‘Liberty and Livelihood’ March on Sun, Sept 22. If you must have a march, why on a Sunday
and not on a Monday, I would expect them to ask. Tell Londoners to take an
extra Bank Holiday, while you exercise your right to roam. That might give
politicians something to ponder on. And I would agree with them. Rotten eggs
left in the House of Commons car park as a reminder of the visit, would also
be on their agenda. We may well be glad of the French before much longer,
if the hints coming out of the Johannesburg Conference are correct. I believe
Margaret Beckett has suggested a rapid reduction in CAP spending to allow
Third World Countries to sell Europe cheap food. Who is that going to help?
Third world farmers as well as first world farmers need to sell food at a proper
price. If anyone is going to block that stupid idea, it will be the French.

September 11th
Ministers Have Proved to Be a Big Failure in Recent Years
”If farmers do not receive extra cash for their milk, supplies will run down,
forcing up the retail price”. Words from Ben Gill, NFU President, or the
Chairman of one of the larger farmer Dairy Co-operatives? No, a quote from
Lord Whitty, Food and Farming Minister, in a cutting from last week’s Times
newspaper, which was given me by an outraged neighbour. The short piece said
that Ministers fear that milk prices could rise this winter as poor rates for dairy
farmers trigger an exodus from the industry. So Lord Whittey has unwittingly,
if you will pardon the pun, come clean on Government policy. Do nothing
for agriculture unless it affects the price of food. If we peasants can carry on
producing milk for peanuts, that’s OK. So long as supplies are sufficient, he can
fold his arms and flannel his way out of awkward questions when accosted by
desperate farmers.
However, what interests me more about Lord Whitty’s wording, if that is
what he actually said, is the inference that the farm price for milk could go up
without an increase in the retail price. Where would any extra cash come from?
The milk processors? They are already being squeezed by the supermarkets,
and I doubt the supermarkets are going to suddenly become generous out of
the goodness of their hearts. Oh yes, they have got hearts, but theirs are of the
accountancy kind; share holders and senior management first, staff and shoppers
second and suppliers last. So what on earth does Lord Whitty mean? What
he will find out, if he does not accept that retail prices must be encouraged
upwards with all the weight Government can muster, is that he may be held
responsible for a massive increase in milk prices when a shortage eventually
25

2002
occurs. Perhaps is he assuming we can import sufficient fresh milk from the
Continent at current UK prices or even persuade people to switch to European
style UHT milk. Doesn’t he realise that as Food Minister, he is responsible to
the nation to see that a milk shortage does not occur.
Sometimes I really do despair at the Farm Ministers we have suffered from
in recent years. The last one did seem to listen with some sympathy, and even
appeared to understand at times, but melted away like summer snow in the heat
of the Foot and Mouth crisis, when it really mattered. His predecessor came
storming in with New Labour, refused to meet anyone at grass roots level and
made decisions that were grossly unfair to some of us, without first checking
the facts. I remember being asked with other farming representatives to meet
his most junior Minister for breakfast in a swank hotel in Plymouth.We were
each allowed to bring up one subject of concern while he progressed through
his bacon and eggs without comment. When we had all finished talking and he
eating, he informed us that his secretary, who had been taking notes,would be
in touch with us. He then spent some minutes lecturing us on our folly in not
ensuring that this posh establishment sold local beer. We took great pleasure
in pointing out that like most farmers, we couldn’t afford to find out what sort
of beer a place like that served.
I am not being party political in making these criticisms. In my opinion,
the worst Minister of the lot recently was the last Conservative holder of that
office. The sight of him on television, dressed like some Australian bush wacker,
trailing round the capitals of Europe behind our then prime Minister trying to
get our beef back on track after BSE, must have made us the laughing stock of
every farmer in the EU. Our industry has been through a very rough ten years
but fate might have allowed us at least one good Minister in that time. Oh for
a Tom Williams, a Lord Amory or a Jim Prior.
We also had the Prime Minister’s farming guru, Lord Haskin, pontificating
on the milk situation last week. For once I agree with him when he suggests
that we need just two or three large farmer milk co-operatives instead of the
plethora of groups we seem to be getting, following the assasination of Milk
Marque by Stephen Byers. I thought Lord Haskin had a hand in that; what a
pity he didn’t speak up then. Milk Marque was only about 50% of the supply.
Eventually I am sure we will achieve some kind of market stability for milk.
The Milk Marketing Board was born out of severe hardship for smaller producers, and what a rock that proved to be for the whole livestock industry. We
can’t go back to that, but time is running out for many of us.

No Shortage of Wildlife

No Shortage of Wildlife
The other day I dug a grave for my wife. Well, actually, my wife asked me to
dig a grave for her old sheepdog, Sammy, who had come to the end of a long
and I hope, happy life. Of all the pets we humans keep, many have a rotten
existence, but working sheepdogs seem to have the best of it. They do what
comes naturally, appear to thoroughly enjoy their work and are remarkably
faithful to one owner. We have always had sheepdogs through the years we
have been farming, but I expect Sammy will be the last. Jenny handed over
the management of the flock a few years ago to our daughter-in-law, so any
successor will have to belong to her. It used to amuse me sometimes to find
that a geriatric Sammy had staggered down to the farm late in the evening and
was standing looking at the sheep in the lambing shed, when he should have
been taking a quick turn round the house before bed. What was he thinking
about or was he thinking at all? I assume they were happy memories.
As usual on these occasions, I dug the grave for Sammy at a spot where we
wanted to plant a tree at some time in the future. That was two reasons for
making a good deep job of it, even though the ground was very dry and hard.
I was surprised, therefore, and not a little annoyed to find three days later that
badgers had excavated poor old Sammy. I reburied him even more thoroughly
but to no avail. I have always understood that badgers will avoid a very potent
human smell, particularly hair or urine, so following this second reburial, I
myself took a turn round the house before bed for three or four nights and this
seemed to do the trick. Not a very dignified way to treat Sammy’s grave, but
when the devil drives. Unfortunately the badgers eventually came back and
I had to pile large stones over the spot to finally defeat them. Planting that
tree will in the end be a bigger job than I had anticipated. I shall certainly
remember Sammy!
Am I sure it was badgers? Yes, there is no question of that. We have plenty
of badgers at present. They wander round at night, knocking over buckets,
looking for kitchen waste and seeing what they can find in the cattle barns.
Recently I found signs that one had got into the roller-mill shed where I hadn’t
bothered to block the entrance. I went down after dark the following night with
a torch, intending to give it a good fright if it was there again. I surprised it all
right; four large badgers thundered out nearly knocking me off my feet. A fifth
went twice round the grain silo before reluctantly ambling off into the night.
Environmental critics of modern farming would be surprised if they were to
look round our farm for evidence of loss of wildlife over the last fifty years. It
27

2002
is true we are less intensive than we used to be since switching from milking to
suckler cows, but we use some inorganic fertilisers and cereal-weed sprays, and
the usual medicines for the stock as we always have done. We have pushed out
hedges when paid to by Government and reclaimed bracken and gorse infested
ground like all our neighbours. But the numbers of wildlife species has remained
remarkably constant.
We currently have 56 species of birds nesting on or near the farm, we
recorded 25 species of butterfly last year, and 22 species of mammals. These
are not my figures, but were compiled by a long time friend and naturalist, Ken
Tyson. Ken worked for the Institute of Grassland and Environmental Research
(IGER) at North Wyke, so he understood the pressures that modern farming
puts on the environment. He was a prominent member of the Devon Wildlife
Trust, a keen ornithologist, and played an important part in the Devon Branch
of Butterfly Conservation. Sadly, he died very suddenly in June at the early
age of 66; we shall miss him greatly and not just as a friend, but for the wealth
of information he gave us about what was going on around us naturally, which
we were generally too busy to notice. He would comment on the way we could
make small adjustments which might benefit certain species.
What is apparent over recent years is the loss of some ground nesting birds,
such as the wood lark, partridge and wild pheasant. We still have some skylarks
and yellow hammers nesting, but they are not as plentiful as they used to be.
We have also lost our hedgehogs and we rarely see a hare now. I have no
doubt the cause for this decline is linked to the growing of maize. We started
planting maize in the early seventies, initially for strip grazing as there were
no contractors equipped to handle it for silage round here. It was very obvious
straight away that badgers thought Christmas had started arriving early. We
were not too bothered as, although we had four badger setts on the farm, we
were not aware of them as a nuisance and rarely saw them unless we went badger
watching when the young came out in early summer.
However, within a very few years we realised that something a bit dramatic
was happening in our badger population. New sets were appearing all over the
farm, badgers could be found feeding in the middle of the day in midsummer,
often in very poor condition, and at night almost every field would have a
few badgers in evidence. At its peak, we had about fifteen setts in use, and
once counted eighteen badgers feeding in a nine acre field. The pressure for
any creature breeding on the ground must have been intolerable. We stopped
growing maize about ten years ago and the badger population is now declining.
I suspect that not only were many more young badgers getting through their
first winter by fattening up on maize cobs, but that sow badgers were breeding
28

Sep 25th

DEFRA’s 30-page Booklets

younger as their condition encouraged the late implantation of the ovum. The
net result was too many badgers with too small a food supply through the
remainder of the year.
There are other examples of changes in wildlife populations having a marked
effect on certain species. I am sure that grey squirrels and magpies, either non
existent or heavily controlled years ago, are responsible for the decline of some of
our more popular songbirds. And I have recently discovered that the increase
in numbers of roe deer, grazing brambles in our woodland, are the probable
cause of the loss of our white admiral butterflies. We need young Ken Tysons
or David Attenboroughs to regularly visit all our farms and discuss with us
what they find. That would do more for the future of the nation’s wildlife
than all the Stewardship Schemes put together. It might also stop some of the
rubbish theories put about by self styled experts. In any event, we are not
short of wildlife here. Our resident hornets have nested this year under the
eaves outside our bedroom window. When you find hornets in bed with you, as
we have, who needs Viagra?

September 25th
DEFRA’s 30-page Booklets
Recently we received a thick envelope containing a 30-page booklet about the
welfare of laying hens. It came from DEFRA HQ in London, so I resisted
the temptation to throw it away unread. The accompanying letter explained
that all stockmen are required by law ‘to be familiar with, and have access to,
appropriate welfare codes’. How did the powers that be know that we keep
half a dozen hens, which look after themselves around the farm buildings laying
their eggs in the most inaccessible places? The letter says they used information
collected as part of the agricultural census, but we haven’t done one for years.
At a quick glance, I could see nothing that had any relevance to our system,
except that we obviously were well up on the ‘Five Freedoms’. What a total
waste of paper. And something similar is coming through the post on a weekly
basis. At the height of the Foot and Mouth crisis, anything from DEFRA would
have been welcome, if only to prove they were there.
However, a more sinister package arrived a few days later. I expect every
farmer has had one of these. It was entitled on the outside ‘Nitrate Vulnerable
Zones: Important information enclosed’, and my heart sank. Yes, it contained
the usual 30-page booklet. Have you noticed that these ministry booklets always
have about 30 pages? Is it assumed that less than that and we will not take
them seriously, but anything larger will exceed our attention span? This one
29

2002
was glossier than usual and was accompanied by a detailed map of our area of
North Devon.
For once it was our lucky day. The map showed that our land is almost
exactly bounded by the edge of the designated zone. One field further and we
would have been in it, in both senses of the well known agricultural expression.
We farm near a watershed. On one side of our approach road, water initially
flows south but, strangely enough, reaches the sea at Barnstaple. On the other
side, our side, water flows north but ends up at Exmouth. Why our side is
cleaner than the other, I have no idea; I would have expected the Taw catchment
area to be less intensively farmed than the Creedy. I must remember in future
which side of the road I am on, if I get taken short on the way home late from
the Pub. I wouldn’t want to make any extra difficulties for my neighbours.
However, for farmers caught up in these regulations, this is no joking matter.
I read through the guidelines and I have to wonder whether this will not be the
final straw for some. At one point, it states that “You are required by law
to meet the obligations in bold text”. The booklet has chunks of bold text
on nearly every page. One of the more simple examples reads “Do not apply
nitrogen fertiliser to steeply sloping fields”. It goes on to say, but not in bold
text, to assess the risk before spreading nitrogen fertiliser. Some eastern counties
farmers I know consider that nearly all our land is steeply sloping. The booklet
wriggles out of this problem by stating that no specific angle of slope is given
in the legislation, but steeply sloping fields are unlikely to be cultivated. Our
steepest field grew wheat in 1890. We gave up making silage in it some years
back because the neighbours complained that we interfered with their work.
They felt they had to watch as they could see whoever was tractor driving
through the roof of the safety cab.
Perhaps I am making too much of all this, but I wonder if people outside
farming really understand what we have to put up with, when they hear us
complaining about the red tape that is throttling us. I know it happens to
all sections of society, but when I started farming, one of the attractions for
a newcomer was the absence of form filling. Having finished school, college,
exams, what a relief to join a profession that didn’t need to do any paper work;
even income tax was levied without doing accounts, ‘Schedule D’ I think it was
called.
To think I would end my career like this. There is one consolation. Like most
farmers, who farm as if they’ll live for ever, one hopes that the next generation
will carry on. If I didn’t wade through the worst of the stuff that comes through
the post, I think my son would have packed it in long ago. He is beginning to
believe that it’s a plot to get rid of all of us.

Give GM Crops a Chance
If I was a young man again, would I go farming now? Without hesitation the
answer would be “Yes”. Am I mad? My wife says “Undoubtedly, but then you
always did like a challenge.” And the way things are, a challenge it certainly
would be. Being a farmer has always seemed to be the most enduring occupation
one could choose. The air we breathe is all around us, although it can be pretty
horrible in some places. Water basically falls out of the sky, but the third
essential for life, food, has to be produced on a day-to-day basis unceasingly.
You would expect agriculture, therefore, with an expanding world population,
to be the safest profession to join. It may not feel like that in Britain at the
moment, but I have absolutely no doubt that circumstances will change.
There is one aspect of society’s view of food production at the present time,
however, that really does worry me. Groups of well-meaning people seem to
spring up every time there is any radical advance in technology, and trumpet
the alarm in the most strident tones. I expect it has been happening since we
learnt how to make fire without waiting for a lightening strike. No doubt, in
those days, the more anxious members of the tribe got together and stamped it
out before it set the world alight. But there was space then to go away quietly
and try it out with nobody looking. Now, anything new is world news within
hours. Of course you have gathered that I am referring to genetically-modified
organisms.
I can well remember a similar situation arising when artificial insemination
was developed in the late 1940s. One of my professors at university at that
time, Dr John Hammond, was a very well-known geneticist. He lectured on
animal reproduction and was, unlike some of the professors, a most amusing
and accomplished speaker; his lectures were packed to the gunnels. He was one
of the foremost scientists at the time involved with the separation and storage
of semen, to allow the development of vast numbers of offspring being sired
by one superior animal. I think I am right in saying that the Milk Marketing
Board was financing some of the research. The days when a runner, generally
me, was sent to the owner of the local village bull, informing him that we had
a cow bulling and could he come immediately, with bull, have long gone. And
what a staggering difference to livestock farming that has made.
One of the asides that Dr Hammond used to include in his lectures, was an
update on the abusive letters he had received from members of the public on the
subject of AI. Apart from the personal attacks on his moral and religious beliefs,
there was real and, no doubt, very proper concern about the effect the use of
31

2002
such techniques would have on human reproduction. Babies without known
fathers, accidental inbreeding, loss of natural human diversity, development of
a master race, and so on. And all perfectly possible. The feelings expressed
were almost the same as we are getting about GMOs today. Should we have
stopped then and should we stop now? I am one of those who think that it is
impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. We have to go on, but make
sure we know what we are doing and control properly those who are doing it.
The idea that we should try to make Britain a GMO-free country is about as
daft as stamping out that prehistoric fire.
Imagining myself as a young farmer starting tomorrow, I would want the
chance to develop and use the enormous potential that these new techniques
could bring. In fact if we were to go down the road of a blanket ban in this
country, I would emigrate immediately. No one disputes that there is a lot wrong
with the way the technology is being developed at present. There cannot be
any sense in allowing the patenting of life forms which gives some multinational
companies a licence to print money. But the possibilities to improve life on
this planet, in its present predicament, are mind-blowing. Genetic engineering
within species could produce food plants that are naturally resistant to pests
and diseases, fix their own nitrogen requirements, become perennial instead of
annual, are salt tolerant and produce increased yields, in a timescale that could
make all the difference to the future. So my message, as a young farmer, would
be don’t ban it, but make absolutely sure it’s done right.

Stepping Stones Through the States
Jenny and I landed in Boston on our way to see my brother in British Columbia.
Watching our approach from the plane window in the hope of getting an aerial
view of the city, there was a moment when I thought we were going to splash
down in the Atlantic. The runway seemed to emerge from the waves as the
wheels touched and the Captain apologized for having to brake so sharply due
to a shortened runway. I suspect he meant that we were landing at high tide. If
sea levels rise at all, with global warming, Boston won’t have an airport. Faced
with similar problems on that scale, one wonders why the U.S. government
doesn’t accept the Kyoto agreement. In fact, the many Americans we talked to
on our long sight-seeing train journey across the States seemed just as concerned
as we are in the U.K. with their government’s reluctance to join the rest of the
world on this issue.
32

Stepping Stones Through the States

When we last visited my brother, who has lived and worked on Vancouver
Island for the past 30 years, we came home by train across Canada, stopping
on route wherever we felt like it, and taking a fortnight to see as many places
and talk to as many ordinary Canadians as we could, before flying back from
Toronto. We so enjoyed the experience that this time, 15 years later, we thought
we would attempt to repeat the journey in the opposite direction in the States,
which we had never visited. The idea was to travel by train from east to west,
and then stay with my brother for a couple of weeks before flying home. Amtrak,
the company that operates the passenger rail service in the US, offers a thirtyday pass costing 250 pounds for rail travel anywhere in America. Boston, from
where Britain started its journey home over 200 years before, seemed the right
place to start.
Getting through immigration proved easy enough, although with a passport
photo having some slight resemblance to Bin Laden’s father and a place of birth
listed in Pakistan, I did expect some reaction. The immigration form we filled
out on the plane included the question, and I kid you not, ‘do you anticipate
being involved in any terrorist activity during your stay?’. However our answer
to the question about being on a farm in the last ten days did get us out of
the queue pretty quickly. Seeing the notices plastered all over the airport about
keeping Foot and Mouth out of the country, we were expecting a little local
difficulty, but the soles of our shoes were all they inspected. I have to say I was
disappointed at losing the chance to report back on the stringent disinfecting
procedures we were forced to undergo. I even volunteered the information that
our farm had been within two miles of an outbreak, but to no avail and we were
sent on our way with the usual American blessing of ‘have a good day’.
Boston proved to be a good choice of city from which to start, on what was
to be a zigzag tour of the northern half of the U.S., dictated mainly by the
Amtrak timetable. We had decided to give each of the cities we visited one
whole day only, using them like stepping-stones across the continent, with a
‘day’ or ‘day and night’s travel between each, and planning ahead only one step
at a time. Boston we gave two days to buy our rail pass and find our feet.
The city is smaller than I had expected. In fact all the American cities
were smaller than one visualizes. But Boston, of all the cities, seems most
conscious of its place in history. The feeling that it was here that America first
discovered its identity is everywhere apparent. A little boat, looking no bigger
than a Brixham trawler, a replica of the one from which the 60 tons of tea
was thrown overboard, in protest at British taxes, is moored in a harbour so
small it is no wonder that the resulting mountain of tea, which rose well above
water level, caused more problems for the British Governor in loss of navigation
33

2002
than loss of revenue. What a pity the Welsh didn’t throw more beef burgers
into Holyhead dock. The name of the midnight rider, Paul Revere appears
on every landmark; the monument on Bunkers Hill to the first independent
battle, which was fought on the wrong battlefield and lost, and ‘Old Ironsides’,
America’s most famous battleship, is awash with tourists. But, as we were to
find everywhere we traveled, the people were extraordinarily friendly, the good
food was expensive, the fast food was diabolical, the weather was a heat wave,
the air-conditioning was freezing, the toilets were called rest rooms. And we
were enjoying our holiday. We moved on to our first view of the American
countryside and New York.

October 23rd
Hurricane Adds Miles to American Saga
Leaving Boston on the first leg of our sightseeing journey to Seattle, we boarded
the train for New York with some little apprehension. This first and shortest
step would determine whether we would survive the next 5000 miles. Jenny is a
great train enthusiast. She enjoys the freedom of movement and seems able to
sleep on a reclining seat while I tend to fidget around trying to get comfortable.
Happily the first impressions were favourable. Passengers are shepherded on
board from a station waiting room and found a seat by a train attendant, as if
joining a plane. The coaches are roomy and the seats comfortable, the dining
car and buffet food sufficient, if uninspiring, and the toilets (the only place in
the States they are not called rest rooms) clean, at least at the start of each
day, and spacious for the ‘Ladies’. Our 250 pound travel pass only allowed us
‘coach class’, so we would have to survive the nights on the longer stretches;
upgrading to first class for a sleeping berth for just one of the nights would cost
us more than the whole trip put together. Looking out at our first view of the
American countryside, which was monotonous enough to allow us to get out
the Amtrak timetables and route maps, we decided we could make it.
I will try not to bore you with too many details of our wandering. Writing
this from the comfort of my brother and sister-in-law’s house on Vancouver
Island in British Columbia overlooking the sea, with the salmon jumping while
they wait to go inland to spawn, I feel I could write a book. Next year I will
probably find it difficult to fill a postcard. Suffice to say, we traveled down
the east coast, stopping first at New York and Washington. We gave each a
full day for sightseeing, New York by bus and river tours and Washington on
foot. New York is unexpectedly the most welcoming city I have ever visited,
building upwards the most natural form of expansion on a small island, and the
34

Oct 23rd

Hurricane Adds Miles to American Saga

pavements permanently crowded with friendly people. Strangely, for a country
bumpkin like me, it was the only city anywhere in the world I would wish to
live.
What we saw of Washington is not really a city at all, just a loose collection
of Government buildings, splendid in themselves, and monuments and museums.
We did find ourselves outside the Department of Agriculture, but it had wisely
closed its visitor centre ten minutes before we arrived. The White House I found
to be surprisingly small and even more surprisingly accessible. It was almost
within sight of our hotel, which itself proved interesting. On arrival we had had
difficulty in finding a moderate hotel with a room available. We ended up in one
with scantily clad statues outside, startling red decor and wall-sized mirrors in
the bedroom. Its proximity to the embassies had us wondering as to the exact
status of the place! After this we generally booked a day ahead if possible.
After Washington, we journeyed south through Virginia, staying at Williamsburg and Charlottesville, and on through the Blue Ridge Mountains, where the
endless conifers really do appear blue as they reach the horizon. We had now
been travelling for a week but further progress south was blocked by hurricane
Isadora coming ashore from the Gulf of Mexico at New Orleans and disrupting
the rail system; we therefore turned north to Chicago. The heat wave, which
had been with us since Boston, came too! So far we had seen very little evidence
of serious farming; a few small fields with a couple of black cows here and there,
but everywhere, shielding our view, nondescript trees with the odd scattering of
clapboard houses. People we talked to seemed very conscious of the prolonged
dry weather and the effect it was having on farming. Having a catfish sandwich
in a cafe in Charlottesville, which was under severe water restrictions, we were
even charged 25 cents for a glass of tap water. (We soon learnt that a sandwich
meant a full sized meal - enough for two.)
However for all the talk of drought, we were coming into the basin of the
great American rivers, with first the Ohio, which flowed past us as we rattled
through the night to the ‘windy city’ of Chicago. From there we headed southwest to St Lois and crossed the mighty Mississippi to follow the Missouri for
100 miles to Kansas City. This was a most memorable part of the trip, viewing
a river that had been over a mile wide while still 1000 miles from the sea until,
according to our train attendant, the early settlers arrived to enclose it with
embankments and make it navigable. We were also at last coming into farming
country, field after field of corn (grain-maize) and soya, some harvested but
much not yet ripe. The fields gradually increased in size, and although continuous, were never larger than about 100 acres, with hedge type boundaries of
straggly trees or uncultivated strips.
35

2002
We were lucky on our way north from Kansas City to find ourselves in the
viewing lounge seated next to a retired Ohio farmer and his wife, who were
returning home from a visit to an ailing brother in Arizona. He was over 80,
but still helped his stepson at harvest time. He had started life as a produce
farmer, as he called it, on 400 acres. He had depended on immigrant labour,
but increasing regulations had forced him to switch to maize and soya. He
explained the simple rotation, that we could see from the train, of disking and
fertilizing after harvest to encourage any weed growth, which was then spray
killed and disked again in spring before sowing with added nitrogen. (We never
saw a plough or ploughed ground in all our travels.) He was pleased his own
son had a good job outside farming, and his stepson had an eight-hour a day
job besides farming the 400 acres. He felt the future for farms his size had
gone. You either farmed as a manager for big business or rented the land to
larger units. He wryly commented that he could earn more than the going rent
by putting land into environmental schemes! Where have I heard that before?
The couple had never travelled before by train, usually they flew to wherever
or went by car, but age had persuaded them to take the slow option. We found
this repeated time and again; over half the Americans, young or old, who we
met on Amtrak were new to rail travel. It is no wonder that Amtrak is having
serious financial problems with its long distance passenger routes.
We left our farming friends and changed trains at the small country town of
Galesburg and headed west for the mile high city of Denver.

October 30th
Nothing Great About Steaks
At Galesburg, Jenny and I boarded the California Zephyr to San Francisco. This
was one of Amtrak’s superliners or double-decker transcontinental trains, with
passengers on the upper deck and services and baggage on the lower. Galesburg,
where we had to wait 6 hours to make our connection, was a pleasant country
town, about the size of our home town of Crediton, with a wide main street
that needed little imagination to take one back to the 19th century. There were
no tourists and it actually rained!
The countryside from Galesburg continued very much as it had from Kansas
City, field after field of soya and maize, some harvested, some hardly ripe. The
crops looked very average at best and in places distinctly poor. The dry summer
had certainly made an impact and I saw nowhere I would wish to farm. The field
size did get larger as we travelled west, but it might do some of the politicians,
36

Oct 30th

Nothing Great About Steaks

who preach farming at world prices, no harm to see the desolate landscape this
produces.
We had decided to break this 2000 mile stage of our trip at Denver, partly
to avoid spending two consecutive nights on a train, but also to see if we could
get a decent steak at a reasonable price. After all, Denver boasted to be the
cattle centre of the world and to have the finest steaks in the world. Rolling into
Denver the following morning, we could see the extensive cattle pens beside the
railway sidings - what about the steaks? The countryside had changed overnight
to more open plain with scattered cattle here and there, and a few small feed
lots, but we saw no great numbers of animals. We were now one mile high and
the air as we left the train felt delightful, after the heat of the previous two
weeks. Denver’s economy now relies on tourism and high-tech industries, which
did not bode too well for that cheap steak. And so it proved.
The restaurants in the splendid new pedestrian shopping mall, where we
ended up after finding a hotel and having a brief look at the sights, were distinctly expensive and very fancy in their menus. There were steaks, but always
on some sort of bread with sauces and cheese on top. After trying half a dozen
places, I finally blew my top in one and asked where we could get a straight
steak flat on the plate with some chips and mustard. That brought out the
cook, who said he would oblige if we liked to come back later. I wondered how
much extra that would cost, but fortunately Jenny saved the day and found
a small bar away from city centre that was happy to oblige. One 14 oz well
matured Angus rib steak char grilled with fries £6 - not bad. But I doubt if
it was pure Angus and I’ve certainly had better steaks at home. So much for
Denver.
The next day, we got back on the train and up and over the Rockies. And
what a fabulous day’s journey that was. We climbed swiftly to 9000 feet; at
one point, to gain height, doing a ‘figure of ten’ according to the viewing car
commentary, (‘two over the eight’ perhaps?). The first snow of the autumn had
fallen the night before, and the fir trees had a light covering. The train goes
through the 6 mile Moffat tunnel, the longest in the world when first built, but
the early settlers with their covered wagons had to go on up another two or
three thousand feet to cross the passes. Looking at the terrain, it is difficult
to imagine how they ever made it, but it was explained that they went very
slowly, only a mile or two a day at the worst places, and that they took up to
three years to reach California.
The scenery from here on was spectacular - through Boulder Canyon, following the Colorado River, past ski resorts, to more open cattle country between
the mountains. The cattle we saw were generally black, but I would hesitate to
37

2002
claim them if I was an Angus breeder. We went through Salt Lake City, which
I would like to at least have seen from the train, unfortunately at night and
reached Reno the following morning. Here there was a 20 minute stop to stretch
our legs while the train crew changed over for the final day’s run, and then on
again through more great scenery in the Sierra Nevada, over the Donner Pass
and down to the flat and fertile land of California.
As you would expect, this was by far the best farmland we had seen. There
were great tracts of arable land, many cattle, cows with calves, sheep, fruit trees,
vines, affluent looking farmsteads, an air of prosperity, but I still wouldn’t want
to farm there. There was a sameness about the countryside, mile after mile,
with little real variation. Until you see the alternative, you don’t realise how
lucky you are, and the British public certainly don’t realise how lucky they are
to have us farming the way we do. Let us hope they realise before it’s too late.
San Francisco proved to be a slight disappointment after all we had heard
about it. The hotel room was the worst so far, the heat wave had caught up
with us again, the trolley ride over the famous undulating hills was packed with
tourists, and there was a huge rally in the park against ‘War with Iraq’ (we
found no American throughout our trip who was for Bush, we were constantly
asked why Blair was backing him). Worst of all, my digital camera vanished on
a crowded trolley-bus on the way to catch a ferry across the bay. I only realised
it as I went to take a picture of Alcatraz - was that a chuckle from a long-dead
inmate, or was it the slap of a wave against the bow? The camera was insured,
but oh for those 100 pictures from Denver onwards. And the Golden Gate
Bridge is nothing to the Clifton Suspension. We did however find the best ever
Farmers Market right in the middle of the city. I know now that ‘dry farmed’
tomatoes are those grown without irrigation - a better selling label there than
organic.
On we went once more on our final leg, a night and day ride to Seattle.

November 6th
Final Leg of the US Saga
We are home again at last. Five weeks is the longest holiday we have ever
managed in 50 years of farming. The winter corn is tilled and up, the cattle
and sheep are all looking well, and the bookwork is up to date. That is one good
thing about growing old - you can take a long holiday without being missed!
There is only one cloud on the horizon - the Visa bill from America, which is
due any day.
38

Nov 6th

Final Leg of the US Saga

The final 24 hours of our American train journey, taking us from San Francisco to Seattle, started in the evening, which meant that we missed seeing 400
miles of some of the best Californian farmland along the Sacremento River. As
daylight came, we were into Oregon and the Cascade Mountains. We stopped
to change crews at the small town of Kalmath Falls, which is over 4000 ft high
and lucky enough to have an unlimited supply of water from hot wells, with a
temperature of 95°C at a depth of 60ft. This is used to heat the entire town
through the winter and even the roads are kept free of snow with hot-water
pipes beneath the tarmac.
Another 50 miles and we were passing through Crater Lake National Park.
This must be a bird-watchers paradise, with 250 species of bird recorded here
and 50 pairs of bald-eagles regularly nesting. Dropping down into more open
country, with vast areas of plains grass interspersed with Ponderosa woodland,
we were told to watch out for a large herd of buffalo, which had been introduced
into the area in recent years. No luck unfortunately, plenty of cattle but with
30 miles to the horizon to hide in, the buffalo kept out of sight.
We now came to our last piece of spectular scenery, and for me, possibly
the best. The train joins the Columbia River Gorge at a great height above the
river and slowly descends over the next 40 miles to river level. The autumn leaf
colours of the aspen and maple were at their best. A young lad of about eight
sitting next to me said he intended to be a farmer when he grew up. He was
returning with his family to a small holding near Kelso, where the Columbia
River runs out to an area of farmland very reminiscent of England. I confess I
gave him every encouragement to pursue his chosen career. It cheered me up
to listen to such enthusiasm from a youngster and at least he has ten years to
think better of it.
We arrived in Seattle at 10.30pm, two hours late, but fortunately with an
hotel-room booked in advance. The city gives the feeling of being at the hub of
an area of the fastest economic growth in the US. The computer giant, Microsoft,
is located in one of the suburbs, and Bill Gates, its founder and the world’s
richest man, has his home there.
We were advised at our breakfast cafe (it is very rare to get breakfast in an
hotel in America) to see the Pike Street Farmers market before catching our bus
on to Canada, and it certainly proved a worthy final attraction. ‘Farmers’ is
perhaps an incorrect title, since it is open daily on three floors of a large building
on the waterfront and sells virtually everything from innumerable stalls. The
main event, which is apparently famous nation-wide, is a fresh fish stall, which
features the three stall holders hurling a ten pound salmon to each other through
the crowded bystanders. This can be very disconcerting if you find yourself in
39

2002
the line of fire. I didn’t see them sell much fish, but a British Lions rugby union
scrum-half might learn a thing or two.
We travelled on that afternoon to be met by my brother in Vancouver, to
enjoy a fortnight’s holiday at his home on Vancouver Island. Jenny reckons she
could have gone on for another week on a train, but I was thankful to at last
get two consecutive nights in a bed. I shall spare you any further details of
our trip, although we did have one interesting visit to a Charolais herd near
Courtenay, which opened our eyes to the absence of red tape in Canada. More
on that, perhaps, and my overall impressions of the US, another time.
We had an uneventful overnight flight back from Seattle, packed in like
sardines in a can. Just as we were boarding, the security officers decided to pull
a few of us out of the queue and give us a very thorough going over. Shoes off,
trouser belts undone, pockets emptied, hand luggage spread out over a table
and sifted through, and a body search (or feel, rather). I found humour proved
the best defence, and even got my scissors passed as being my shaving tackle,
but some of the other victims looked distinctly starchy.
At Heathrow we saw no officials of any description, no mention of illegal
meat imports or ‘Foot and Mouth’, and just a rainy windy English morning to
greet us.And, in spite of being dog tired in a crowded bus running late on a
crowded motorway, it was impossible not to appreciate the beauty of our own
English countryside, getting ever better as we came west to Devon.

November 13th
Time to Get Together
It seems that nothing has changed on the farming political front during our
five weeks absence from the UK. I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised, although I
did expect that echoes from the Countryside March might still just be audible.
We knew it took place; we saw a brief picture on an American TV news of the
crowds in London, with the caption “Toffs march in defence of their sport”. Was
Government moved at all by the show of feeling which the number of people
taking part was supposed to generate? Without access to back numbers of the
newspapers, I shall never really know. Certainly, statements from Ministers or
Government spokesmen seem as negative as ever about the future of farming.
Margaret Beckett, at long last pinned down by the Western Morning News,
says she does care about the farming industry, but I see nothing in her interview
with Jason Groves to suggest that we are expected to produce the bulk of the
nations food. In fact, the news on Friday of the British Government-backed
“arms for agriculture” deal with Thailand implies the exact reverse, if it is true
40

Nov 13th

Time to Get Together

that Britain has agreed to negotiate a reduction in European hygiene standards
to help Thailand export more food.
And that other ‘bete noire’ of British agriculture, Lord Haskins, is still
predicting that thousands of small farmers will be driven out of business over
the next few years. Note that word ‘driven’; I presume he means that economic
circumstances will persuade them to leave farming for another profession, but
it does sound a bit like some sort of Government ‘pogrom’. No mention of
retirement schemes or help to make the transition to larger farm businesses.
However, for me, the most depressing news to come back to is the emergence
of yet another farming political pressure group - “Farm”. I won’t go over ground
well covered by Anthony Gibson in these pages last week, but I do feel that a
lot of the blame for the emergence in recent years of so many different voices
speaking on our behalf, and, as a result, very often muddling the real message,
does lie with the NFU. Anthony may or may not agree with me, but his position
as NFU Regional Director does preclude him from giving his own opinion on
this.
I have been a member of the NFU for over fifty years. I have done my stint
as a branch office holder and, more recently and surprisingly, three years as a
county office holder. I think, therefore, that I am fully entitled to criticise the
only organisation that has any real hope of getting through to the politicians
and the people of this country before it is too late.
To do that, we have got to get all these disparate groups together to speak
with one voice. And to do that, in my humble opinion, Ben Gill, the leader
of the largest, oldest and best financed farming organisation, needs to be big
enough to admit that the NFU has failed in the past to fully represent all our
members by ensuring there was a proper balance of interests on NFU’s governing
Council. He could then embrace, if that is the right word, all the Farmers for
Action, Family Farmers, Small Farmers, and other farming associations on an
equal basis and get a proper dialogue going.
In so doing, he might well lose his position as President at the NFU AGM
in February, but he will have done more for all of us than anything he might
achieve with two more years in office. Perhaps he is already down this road; I
am no longer party to the inner workings of the NFU, if I ever was. I do know
that I am probably making myself unpopular with many friends in the NFU
by suggesting that we should admit to any past failures. There is no denying,
however, that it has been virtually impossible in the past for a family farmer,
with no employee or adult children to help, to become an NFU Council member.
Considering the proportion of farmers that could be categorised in this way, it
is a disgrace that the constitution of the NFU was not changed years ago to
41

2002
correct this imbalance. Had it been, I can think of many areas where decisions
on policy might well have been very different.
In the last three years, I am glad to say, the rules governing the election of
Council members have been altered. All members now have a postal vote, and
there is no requirement for would be candidates to work their way up through
the various regional committees to be selected as a suitable representative to go
to London. The question of proper payment for the time involved needs to be
addressed, but at least the Michael Harts and David Handleys of our industry
can now take a full part in the NFU at the highest level, before feeling the
need to set up small focused groups as a criticism of the one organisation which
should speak for all of us.

Restaurant Waste Raises One Weighty Discussion
I was asked the other day in our village shop - yes, we still have one, thank
goodness - by a friend who had read about our recent rail journey across the
States, whether I hadn’t found America ‘vast’. I said this was not a description
that immediately sprang to mind. We only really travelled through the northern
half of the country, and did not see the ranch lands of Texas or the deserts of
the south west states.
The Great Plains, which we crossed in about ten hours, is only 700 miles
from east to west, and although it is almost continuous flat arable farm land,
it is broken up into distinct fields, with nowhere a single crop stretching to the
horizon. The only place I have been which I would describe as vast is the prairie
land of Alberta in Canada. Crossing that by train, some years ago, we could
look out of the window as it got dark, at a combine harvester in an endless
crop of wheat and, the next morning, wonder for a minute whether the train
had stopped over night, and we were looking at the same combine in the same
stretch of wheat.
There was, however, one aspect of the States where the description ‘vast’
might be accurate. I must be careful here in my choice of words. I wouldn’t want
to offend the extremely friendly people we met everywhere we went; we have
the other half of their country yet to see, preferably after winning the lottery!
I am referring to the physical appearance of too many young Americans, most
noticeably in the eastern cities we visited. To say they were overweight would
be an understatement. They looked reasonably fit, attractive and well dressed,
although their choice of clothes sometimes left little to the imagination. But
42

Nov 20th

Restaurant Waste Raises One Weighty Discussion

some parts of their anatomy could only be described as gigantic, which is as
polite as I can put it.
I know we have a problem here with obesity in young people, and health
authorities in all the rich nations are voicing concern on the long term effects
on human health, but this was something else again. I don’t think the fast food
industry is the only culprit, although I am pleased to see that ‘McDonalds’
is changing its ways somewhat by going over to waitress service and extended
menus.
In America, everywhere we went we were given very large portions and,
judging by the other diners, expected to leave what we couldn’t eat to be thrown
in the trash bin. In fact we hardly ever saw anyone clean up their plate, it
appeared to imply to the restaurant that their portions were meagre. I have
always felt that leaving food indicated that one didn’t like it - a throw back to
war time rationing perhaps - but we found that, by explaining that we were on
a budget, we could easily get a single portion split onto two plates without even
a raised eyebrow.
One interesting Chinese ‘breakfast and lunch’ restaurant we found in Washington sold meals by weight - so many dollars a lb. The food was excellent,
the coffee was free, and having loaded your tray from a huge range of choices,
you placed it on a scales and paid accordingly. That was one place no food
went into the bin. It was crowded and the owner, who was happy to explain his
philosophy said he saved a great deal of time since nothing needed individual
pricing. It was also pretty simple at the check out. I hope the idea catches on,
I don’t like the attitude that food is so cheap it can be thrown away.
Obviously it isn’t only the quantity of food that is to blame for obesity,
poor quality must play a big part in turning people off healthier eating. It was
very encouraging to see how well patronised the weekly city food markets were,
in both the US and Canada. They were manned by farmers rather than semiprofessional stallholders as is often the case here, and the produce was first class.
I was a little puzzled, however, at the rather vague way the term ‘organic’ was
used to describe most of the produce on offer. The farmers implied, when asked,
that they farmed organically, but it seemed to be their own interpretation of
that system of farming, rather than any set of rules that they were following.
They would be breaking the law in the UK.
While we were there, it was announced that the US Department of Agriculture was setting new standards for what qualifies for an ‘organic’ label, so
no doubt this anomaly will be put right. More interestingly, because of the increased bacterial resistance to antibiotics in humans, Senator Edward Kennedy
is sponsoring a bill to ban the use of all antibiotics in farming, except for the
43

2002
treatment of sick animals. It was estimated that the cost of producing meat
without the use of antibiotics would average $5 to $10 a year to the consumer.
Perhaps the use of hormones in beef production in the US will be banned next
- wonders will never cease.

November 27th
When Foot and Mouth Was Just a Fact of Life
I can well remember, in the spring of 1951, standing on the top of a hill about
a mile from where I am now writing and being shown a large depression in the
ground. I had just started farming and, having enjoyed a welcoming supper,
was being given a stroll round his acres by my neighbour. What did I think that
was? A bomb crater I guessed. No, that is where all the animals were buried
after a ‘Foot and Mouth’ outbreak on the farm in 1935. It had apparently made
little long term impact on the farm or the neighbourhood; outbreaks occurred
from time to time but the perceived wisdom then was that no farmer went bust
after going down with the disease. The compensation allowed one to start again
with improved breeding stock; remember in those days there was no A.I. and
quality in farm animals often left much to be desired.
My next experience of F&M was 1967. The disease had broken out in
Shropshire and was spreading south. This was, for those days, a very serious
outbreak. It was decided by farmers that we should disinfect the wheels of all
vehicles crossing the Devon border, in an attempt to keep the disease out of the
south west peninsular. With the help of local NFU branches, we were formed
into teams of three or four people to operate four-hour shifts at check points on
every road into the county.
So it was that I found myself, with two friends, on a dark night on the
road between Taunton and Bampton doing the 2am to 6am watch. Very little
happened until it started to get light. The odd passing car was quite amenable
to being stopped. After driving slowly over a layer of disinfectant-soaked straw,
its wheels were sloshed with disinfectant from a watering can. But the early
morning lorries were generally not so helpful. The drivers were impatient to
get on and told us we were wasting our time. Some charged straight through
our signals, staring fixedly ahead or even giving us the V sign. We decided
that long distance lorries were probably the most dangerous contacts and must
be made to stop. Two of us, therefore, stood in the middle of the road with
our backs to the oncoming traffic while the third stood by with the watering
can. It worked - it takes a brave lorry driver to knock down two people with
a witness watching. F&M never reached the south west, but whether we made
44

Nov 27th

When Foot and Mouth Was Just a Fact of Life

any difference we shall never know. We all got home safely - ‘road-rage’ hadn’t
then been invented.
Will we, I wonder, talk so flippantly in the years to come about what farmers
and the rural community have been through in the last 18 months? The ’67
outbreak seemed just as dire at the time. There were horrendous pictures in
the media of piles of burning carcasses; a slaughter policy was considered as
efficient in dealing with the disease as continental vaccination methods, where
the disease occurred more often.
There is one big difference this time that will leave an enduring bitterness.
I am referring to the bungling inefficiency of our political masters with which
the whole sorry saga was handled. What an irony that many of us, who had
escaped the disease, began to wish we hadn’t.
Like many farmers, we were heavily overstocked as the summer wore on, with
over-fat lambs and beef cattle grazing our silage and hay fields and no hope of
making half enough fodder for the coming winter. After the worst appeared
to be over, we were suddenly served with a ‘D’ notice, effectively closing us
down for three weeks. It could not have happened at a worse moment - we had
fat cattle long over due for slaughter, which were licensed and booked to go.
Apparently there had been a case in sheep on a farm 25 miles from us, in a
parish which already had an outbreak. A lorry had delivered feed to that farm
the day after visiting us. The sheep were diagnosed one day after that. In vain
I argued with the Ministry of the nonsense of attributing the infection back to
us. With a minimum three day incubation period, and no sign of disease in our
animals, how could we possibly be implicated. But no, the rules from London
stated that any farm visited by a feed lorry up to 48 hours before an outbreak
must be issued with a ‘D’ notice.
A month later, with our ‘D’ notice cleared, the animals were licensed again
and ready to go. This time, the license was revoked at two hours notice, because
the status of the abattoir had been changed in London overnight. Yes, we could
still send the animals to the same abattoir but we needed a different licence
form. It would take two days to obtain. We lost our place in the queue of
farms waiting to dispose of animals long past their prime. If you can believe
it, three weeks later when we thought we had finally cracked it, the abattoir
at Torrington burnt down. I suppose I should have expected it - our cattle
were due there the next day. At least, that couldn’t be laid at the door of the
Ministry.
Although we had to buy tons of extra feed, we were one of luckier farms.
Many suffered far far worse from the cock ups caused by officials in London
making decisions, the implications of which they had not the faintest notion.
45

2002
Perhaps it was unfortunate that a General Election got mixed up in the plot. Or
that the spectre of BSE still hung over us. Certainly the contraction of the State
Veterinary Service by previous Conservative administrations had a considerable
bearing on the way the outbreak was handled in the field. Whatever the reasons,
the horrors of that summer will remain with us all for many years to come. I
hope the F&M report from the European Parliament is the final one. It is time
to close the book. We must now ensure that the lessons really are learned this
time.

December 4th
Farming Is for the Birds
This week we are starting to bring the cattle in for the winter. We normally keep
them out as long as possible into December, which shortens the winter tedium
of strawing out the covered yards and cleaning the feed passages. Our light
land doesn’t poach easily and the cattle are much healthier living outside, but
my son, Jim, has decided that, with near record rainfall in November, enough
is enough. Following the horrors of last year, we have reduced our suckler herd
down to 55 cows and 90 followers, which, on 250 acres of pasture, would be
considered by most farmers as being very under stocked. The cattle also have
access to about thirty acres of woodland at the edges of the pasture fields, where
they can shelter in the worst weather. A few years ago we had 85 suckler cows
plus followers, and even with that number we were farming very extensively.
As all beef farmers will agree, every beef animal we sell at current prices is
making a loss. It seems the only way to stay in business at present is to farm so
as to obtain as much of the EU beef subsidy money as we are entitled to, while
keeping the number of loss making cattle down to a minimum. This is a quite
disgraceful state of affairs now, but if the politicians have their way and phase
out production subsidies over time, pure beef production in this country will
eventually disappear altogether. Unless, that is, alternative support systems
are put in place which will allow us to go on producing what is best for this
farm. If we are to farm here in the way that society sees as appropriate to the
English countryside and, at the same time, produce food at world prices, then
there has to be some system of support.
With this in mind, Jim applied 18 months ago to join the ‘Stewardship Grant
Scheme’, which is all that is available at present as an environmental alternative.
We have just completed our first year of a ten year plan. In our case, we are
continuing to farm very much as we always have, but with the fencing and
hedge laying being paid for, for a change. As our fields only average about
46

Dec 4th

Farming Is for the Birds

eight or nine acres, we are probably earning as much from this as most, but this
would nowhere near replace the direct subsidies we get for our beef production
if these are to disappear. There are other aspects to the Scheme which pay us to
stop applying any manure, organic or inorganic, to certain fields and to restrict
grazing to specific times of the year to encourage wild flowers. We are even
paid to fence off some areas altogether from cattle to encourage other forms of
wildlife; that’s OK by me if it is considered the correct way to spend money
from the public purse, but it won’t produce much beef. The Scheme, which on
the whole seems to be working well, needs considerably beefing up, if I may put
it like that, if it’s going to do the job.
I suppose that is the thinking behind one of the ideas that came out of
the ‘Curry Report’ on the future of farming. The new ‘Broad and Shallow’
Stewardship scheme that will be available to all farmers in three years time
and which is going on trial on 50 farms in the Tiverton area is the result. I
understand that to qualify, farmers will merely have to demonstrate that their
system of farming is benign to the environment in their locality. As we are
already in another Scheme, it seems we are to be excluded from benefiting, no
matter that we, ourselves, are currently paying for this new scheme through
modulation. But I am not losing any sleep over it; it is going to be hardly
worth bothering with, if the figures I have heard are correct. I suspect it will
be a case of ‘Shallow’ by name and shallow by nature.
I would, however, like to know who is actually dreaming up the criteria for
qualifying for this new scheme. The nine people who have been appointed to
the Implementation Group of the Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy do
not strike me as being experts on environmental matters, (with a title like that,
who needs a committee). If I may pick out one instance that particularly gets
up my nose, why do we just have a representative from the Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds on this new Quango. I have nothing against the gentleman
in question, he may be admirably suited to the job for all I know, but I thought
the RSPB was a single issue charitable organisation. I see that his qualification
on DEFRA’s press release is put as simply that. I have every respect for the
aims and achievements of the RSPB, but I see no reason why my profession
should be saddled with their particular concerns. I suppose it accurately sums
up this Government’s view of the future of British agriculture - farming is for
the birds.

Wrath of Bird Lovers
Last Friday, I went as usual to collect our weekly box of organic veg from Phil
and Helen at Linscombe Farm. If they are not too busy, I quite enjoy arguing
the pros and cons of organic farming. I was, therefore, somewhat taken aback
to be hailed by Phil, before I had hardly opened the car door, as the ‘man who
hates the RSPB’. Apparently that was the impression I had left him with, after
reading my comments last week on the Government’s appointment of Graham
Wynne, of the RSPB, to the new body overseeing the changes to the food and
farming industries.
I was intending to write about something else this week, but if that’s how it
appeared, perhaps I had better put the record straight. I love birds, I wouldn’t
dare say otherwise. As Phil pointed out to me, birds are a good, though not
the only, indicator of the health of the environment. I am not a member, but
I am all in favour of the RSPB and the work they do in keeping birds at the
forefront of our attention. I believe they have by far the largest membership
of any society in the UK. (I guess if they were all to vote one way in a general
election, they just might affect the colour of a new government - perhaps Tony
Blair is conscious of that.)
Having said that, I have to confess to being irritated by the way any variation
in bird numbers is generally portrayed as a decline due to modern farming.
Without farming many of the common birds wouldn’t be here at all. The
skylark, that defining bird of good agricultural practice, which we have in small
numbers at present on our farm, would certainly disappear very quickly under
a tide of oak and ash forest.
What worries me far more than changes in the way we farm, is the effect
modern life is having on birds in this crowded island. I don’t really give a fig for
the cirl bunting, which has been brought back from near extinction with great
effort on farms in the Kingsbridge area. It is a small uninteresting species,
which I believe is common in Europe, a relative of the yellowhammer, a much
prettier bird, that is itself in decline on farmland. A bird I really care about is
the nightingale.
Jenny complained a while ago that she had never heard a nightingale and
you can’t go through life without hearing a nightingale at least once. I don’t
think there are any left in Devon. There used to be some nesting on the common
at Chudleigh Knighton, but when we were there some ten years ago, we heard
nothing but the traffic on the Exeter to Plymouth dual-carriage way.
So a year ago last spring, we went to Walliswood, a small hamlet in Surrey
48

Dec 11th

Wrath of Bird Lovers

between Horsham and Guildford, where I lived as a teenager. It was famous
for the number of nightingales nesting there, so much so, that in early May it
was almost difficult to get to sleep at night for the noise they made. It was
where the BBC used to make recordings for background to nature programmes.
I have to admit that we locals used to feel like throwing an old boot into the
bushes sometimes to shut them up.
When we arrived, things looked hopeful. More people perhaps, but Surrey
was always overcrowded. The farm land and woods looked comparatively unchanged. However, a chat with the daughter of the farmer I first worked for,
did not auger too well. She had not heard a nightingale in years. Nor had
anyone in the house where I used to live or in any of the pubs in the area. We
listened well into the night at all the likely spots, before we realised that we
were hearing airliners passing over head at regular intervals. We were on the
flight path of Gatwick Airport, ten miles away.
We found our nightingales a few days later, about thirty miles away in west
Sussex. We put our heads in at the door of a 16th century pub and asked if they
knew of any thereabouts. Two pairs in the garden at the back and one in the
front was the answer. There was a double room either side, with a bathroom in
between - we could take our choice. An old boy drinking in the corner said his
nightingales were louder than the pub’s, and he could do us a room cheaper.
The breakfast menu and the bath, a 7ft iron one the likes of which I last saw
watering cattle, settled it - the back room in the pub. The nightingales sang
all night. As someone once wrote ‘that marvellous crescendo on a single note
which no other birds attempt’. At dawn a couple of blackbirds, those finest
songbirds of all, joined in and, by the time we got up, a nearby rookery was
providing the chorus.
So, if you have never heard a nightingale, I suggest you go there next spring.
The pub is at Balls Cross, five miles north of Petworth. Who knows - they may
already be planning a new airport or motorway in the area. A few more years
and you could be too late.

December 18th
Times That Seem a World Away
Christmas shopping - not my favourite occupation. That sounds like Scrooge,
but you know what I mean. It’s not buying the presents; it’s the full car parks,
the shoulder to shoulder crowds and the check-out queues that get me down.
But not this year. We went to Exeter to combine our shopping trip with a
visit to the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, where there is an exhibition on
at present called ‘Love, labour and loss’. It shows 300 years of British Livestock Farming in Art, starting with paintings by the likes of Turner, Constable,
Landseer (could he paint animals) and others, and goes on with a collection of
the familiar paintings of those monstrous farm animals like the ‘Durham Ox’.
The exhibition takes up five galleries and brings one right up to the present
with a photographic record of the trauma of FMD on one west Devon farm. I
could have done without Damien Hirst’s ‘Dead calf in a tank of formalin’; it
looks horribly prophetic but I doubt if any livestock farmer would regard it as
‘art’. That aside, it is a great collection, and the shopping seemed to go well
afterwards.
For me, the exhibition inevitably brings back the memories of a life’s time
farming in Devon. What an extraordinary 50 years to have lived through, with,
I think, greater changes in that time than all the previous years put together.
I remember my first Christmas here. I don’t recall exactly the work on that
particular day, but we must have done the morning milking as usual. We had
eleven cows, ten Guernseys plus a Jersey belonging to Nancy, the wife of my
partner, John. (In case you are wondering, Jenny was in the future - she was
still at school.)
We milked by hand, the cows being tied up for the whole winter in a shippen,
which was normal for those days. Thank God for Nancy, she could milk twice
as fast as John or me, and just writing about it brings back the cramps in my
hands. After milking, the milk churns were tied to the luggage rack of the car
and taken the two miles to the milk-stand at the end of our lane. It wasn’t so
much a case of hurrying to catch our ‘Channel Island’ milk lorry, which went
early, as making sure we beat Jasper Colton, our neighbour, whose lorry went
later. If he got out into the lane first, you’d had it. His horse never went faster
than a walk and there was nowhere to overtake. He would look steadfastly
ahead, sitting on his churns in the butt-cart, but I suspect he had a smile on
his face. Occasionally the laugh was on him. The end of our lane slopes down
into the main road, and on icy mornings, his horse had difficulty stopping. The
50

Dec 18th

Times That Seem a World Away

sight of the horse sitting down in the shafts of the two-wheel cart, with Jasper
struggling to keep his churns upright was almost worth missing the lorry for.
The morning chores of cleaning out the shippen, bedding up and feeding
the cows and young stock, the three saddleback sows, and the deep litter hens,
didn’t take very long. However that still left the job of cranking up our old
spade-lug Standard Fordson tractor and driving out to the root field to cut
enough ‘marrow stem’ kale with a machete to cart back for the cattle. For
Christmas, the hay would have been cut out and fetched the day before from
which ever hay-rick was currently open. We made hay with a sweep and hay
pole, which meant stacking out in the fields.
With the evening milking finished, the essential day’s work was done. That
first year, John’s Uncle Dick had come down to join us. He was a bachelor
schoolmaster from Bolton and he had brought his housekeeper with him to
cook our Christmas dinner. She was a German lady of fair size and middle
years, which is the kindest way I can describe her. I think her name was Helga
and I have no idea how she got from Germany to Bolton. Uncle Dick had also
brought down a super petrol Tilley lamp to help with the farmhouse lighting.
He didn’t think much of ours, which were the normal paraffin models.
With no mains electricity, and a limited supply of water from a surface well,
Helga was still sure she would give us a meal to remember. I have absolutely no
recollection of the main course, but instead of Christmas pud, we were going to
have apple strudel and doughnuts. To do that, Helga said she needed a very hot
Aga, so the Aga draught control was put on full from early morning. By the
time we got in after the evening milking, the kitchen was unbearably warm, the
Aga was going like a blast furnace and Helga had used about a months ration
of phurnacite nuts. And she was going to need about three weeks butter ration
to make the doughnuts.
Its incredible now to remember that over five years after the end of the war,
we were still rationed for almost everything - meat, fats, sugar, petrol, coal,
and, I think, clothes. Even cattle, pig and poultry feed required ration tokens.
However, to hell with rationing, it was Christmas.
Uncle Dick seemed to have disappeared. “He’s in the cupboard under the
stairs” said John. “He’s trying to light his Tilley lamp. He says this farmhouse
is so draughty, he can’t get the petrol to vaporise. He’s brought aviation fuel
specially, it gives an even brighter light.” We had a thatched roof but at least
we had the telephone connected - it was number 13, the last one left on the local
exchange. Not that I think a fire engine would have got to us, lorries couldn’t
get down our lane in those days. Happy days. That was Christmas that was,
but I wouldn’t go back.

A Future Full of Optimism
Christmas is a time for nostalgia, but not all my memories are entirely happy
ones. There have been years when, with the overdraft, unpaid bills, and everpresent cows to be milked, I have regretted, on Christmas Day, not having
chosen another profession. But New Year’s Day always seems to give my spirits
a lift; things are bound to get better, the days are starting to get longer or
perhaps I am just an eternal optimist. And certainly if you are a farmer at the
present time, an optimist you have got to be.
I was amused therefore, the other day, to read a 150 year old article from a
reprint of the first edition of ‘The Field’. It was dated 1st January and entitled
‘Agricultural Prospects for 1853’. It included the sentence ‘There is nothing
to be done with a class which feels itself defeated and dispirited, for under
feelings of disappointment and despair the most rational and practical plans of
improvement are dismissed with disgust, almost without examination’.
What an uncanny echo from the past. The article begins by saying that the
prospects for 1853 were decidedly cheering. This was the opinion of farmers
at the Smithfield Show of that year; that the worst was over, that any future legislative changes must be for the better, and that prices “must continue
steadily on the advance”. I didn’t go to Smithfield this year, so I don’t know
if there were any similar feelings in the show-going farmers of today. Certainly,
if my memory of agricultural history is correct, those ancients were right to
be optimistic, they were at the start of the 20 years that are now described as
the ‘golden age’ of British farming. Even in the depression that followed, due
largely to increasing food imports, there seems to have been opportunities for
enterprising farmers to get on in the world.
My father-in-law used to enjoy regaling me with tales of his family’s move
52

Jan 1st

A Future Full of Optimism

from a small farm in Cornwall when he was a lad of fifteen. Apparently there was
the chance of a tenancy of a thousand acre farm in Hertfordshire, so Grandfather
Rowe upped and hired a train, taking the family - wife, seven sons and four
daughters, the livestock,machinery, furniture, goods and chattels, the lot, and
moved. And 100 years later, the senior cousins are still there, owner occupiers
now, and with wider acres. All the sons became farmers, most very successfully,
and all because of the downturn in farming fortunes. It was a story that was
repeated many times then, with farmers from the west and north moving to the
better land in the south east.
I know the situation in farming is very different today, with the big estates and their tenant farmers no longer the norm, but my father-in-law always
maintained that the chance to move and expand was due to the inability of the
fat-cats to tighten their belts when the going got tough. While I don’t think
the opportunities for the young farmers of the future will occur quite in that
way, I am sure that, even now, there are some who will grab this chance to get
started or, more importantly, get bigger.
But my real reason for being optimistic this New Year’s Day has nothing to
do with the past. I don’t think history repeats itself, just that we go on making
the same old mistakes. Yes, I do believe the worst is over, that Government is
beginning to consider changes through the Curry Report which may help, that
prices have firmed a little with a weaker pound. But what I think is decidedly
cheering, to use the words of 150 years ago, is the sense of realism that is at
last showing itself.
Talking to my farming neighbours, I detect a growing determination to survive the present difficulties by doing whatever it takes. I don’t know of any
farmer round here about to give up. They are looking at all the options to earn
extra income on or off the farm. And they are not the ageing farmers we keep
hearing about. Yes, there are still quite a few oldies like me who are putting the
average age up, but many of us are really here in name only as partners in the
business or with our name still on the deeds for tax reasons. The real farmers
are the next generation down or even two generations down.
And something very significant has been announced recently by Government,
and therefore by society through the ballot box. Farmers are no longer required
to ensure the nations food supply. It has been hinted at for some time, but
now its out in the open. And it seems we are no longer to be regarded as the
unpaid guardians of the countryside. A price has actually been put on that ten pounds an acre. If we are to farm without production subsidies, we can
manage the environment if we find it economic to do so. The moral obligation
53

2003
which most of us accepted willingly, disappears. I wonder if society has thought
that one through.

The Plight of Small Family Farms
We keep on hearing that small family farmers are threatened with extinction,
that somehow they are being forced out of existence by the supermarkets or
politicians or an uncaring urban public. Eminent people extoll their virtues as
if they were a rare species without which the countryside would fall apart or,
at the very least, be the poorer for their passing. I recently heard it suggested
quite seriously that small farmers should receive a higher price for their produce,
particularly milk, in order to help them survive. I don’t know who was supposed
to pay for this ‘small farmer’ premium; Government I presume.
Even the Prince of Wales has joined the chorus by stating in an article for
the Farmers Weekly that he believes family farmers are hefted people who have
cared for their land from one generation to another. Much as I appreciate his
support for our industry, that remark is unworthy of him. Does he really think
that we are like sheep in having to learn our business through some sort of
active association with our forbears? In this day and age, that is somewhat
patronising. About the only aspect of farming we were likely to learn was how
to be stubborn and narrow minded enough to survive the inevitable farming
depressions which occurred roughly every other generation. When I started
farming, a war every thirty or forty years was viewed as a necessary evil for
a family’s farming survival. What an appalling generalisation, which no one
would want to perpetuate today.
But what exactly is meant by small family farmers? And do they really care
for our rural environment and preserve our cultural heritage any better than
farmers engaged in the management of large farm businesses? I hardly think so.
They are generally under such pressure to make ends meet that they haven’t
the time for those sort of niceties.
In the 50s, we used to have three 50 acre farms adjoining us. Two were
small dairy farms and the third was a fairly intensive pig farm, although the
pigs were kept outdoors as far as possible. Under continued pressure to make
a living, our pig-farming neighbours bulldozed seven acres of larch woodland
to make more room for their pigs. After a succession of owners, the land was
divided between ourselves and new neighbours with horses. Our half is now
under a Stewardship Scheme, and the seven acres of flattened woodland is being
managed as a wildflower meadow.
54

Jan 8th

The Plight of Small Family Farms

Of the dairy farms, one was quickly swallowed up as off-land by a larger
farm. The other continued successfully as a dairy farm for a number of years,
before the owners, and by then great friends, decided to retire to an easier job,
buying a fishing trawler at Brixham. Out of the frying pan, into the fire - but
happily they are now retired. The farm was eventually bought by a non-dairy
farmer, who decided to put it all down to corn. To do that successfully with
time to work off the farm, he started to eliminate the hedges to arrive at one
50 acre field instead of the nine small ones. I am glad to say, he was dissuaded
before he had reduced the farm to a mini prairie. The present owner has planted
25 acres to Douglas Fir, but the farm will become residential, as so many are at
this time. Thus three farms that once, under duress, produced a living for three
families, are only now contributing to the well being of the natural countryside.
Of course today, 50 acre farms would not be considered small family farms.
Most people would agree that two or three times that amount of land is the
absolute minimum required to give full time employment, without specialist
marketing or an outside job. In fact between 200 and 300 acres is probably
nearer the size of a viable unit to produce anything like the income that a
young farmer should be aspiring to in the 21st century, if he is paying rent or a
mortgage.
And at the end of the day, who wants to be a small farmer? I know that
existing farmers with smaller acreages feel bitter that they are being savagely
treated by the current depression which is not of their making. To somehow
slant prices in their direction might help them in the short term, but is surely
not an answer. These farms are really the first rung on the ladder for new
entrants and the proper solution is for them to become available through rent
or purchase with an industry funded low interest scheme for genuine young
farmers. That is how I, and many of my generation, got going on a small
acreage with a large mortgage from a Government underwritten Agricultural
Mortgage Corporation. (The AMC has unfortunately been sold to one of the
big banks and has, in my opinion, lost its independence.)
That helped the farmers, retiring when I started, get a better price for their
holdings. I think it is the proper way to spend the modulated funds which are
now being diverted from production subsidies to the environment. Let’s use the
money to give the next generation a kick-start instead of helping the birds.

MVF Showed the Way
If I were asked to name any one individual who had made the greatest impact
on my farming income over the years, I would, without hesitation, reply ‘John
James’. John, as I am sure everyone in the South West knows, was one of
a small group of farmers who, in 1960, founded Mole Valley Farmers. At a
time when Government guaranteed at least an element of profit on what we
produced through the Deficiency Payments System, farmers were being taken
to the cleaners by the agricultural supply companies. Everything we needed to
run our farms, from fertilisers and machinery to the humble wellington boot,
was available only from large national companies who were happy to benefit
from any apparent agricultural prosperity. We were buying retail but selling
wholesale.
Mole Valley Farmers was not the only buying group around in those days.
The concept of buying wellington boots, for example, in sufficient volume to
trade directly with the manufacturers at the maximum discount hardly needed
a degree in business management to succeed. The trick was to do it as cheaply as
possible. Every aspect of the business had to be geared to keeping overheads to
a minimum and, more importantly, ensuring that any profit was only evident
in the farm accounts of the members of the co-operative. Said like that it
sounds simple, but in practice, running a business is extremely difficult for
senior management where efficiency is all, and the yardstick of ‘profit’ is denied,
excepting what is required to keep bank managers and trade creditors happy.
Many of the fledgling farmer co-ops of the 60s and 70s have not survived,
but fortunately for those of us farming down here, MVF went on to become the
dominant and most successful agricultural supply company of the region. I am
sure the reason for this was due the fact that John, as the driving force for 25
years, and with the help of his fellow founding farmers, never lost sight of those
basic co-operative principles.
There is, of course, a great deal more to establishing a successful company
than that. And, as a long time friend, I am very aware of how much more there
is to John than his determination for the continuing success of MVF. I raise
the subject now because we have reached a time in farming’s progress when
co-operation is again the watchword for the future. Just as 40 years ago we
were the victims of the large supply companies, we are now dominated by large
purchasing businesses, the supermarket chains. The only way we can prosper
has to be by setting up equally large farmer companies to trade with them on
our behalf.
56

Jan 15th

MVF Showed the Way

Why are we so slow to do so? There is, I think, one important reason. We
have little faith in our ability to succeed. Our past efforts at managing ‘selling’
co-ops are littered with failures. We have tried often enough but the agricultural
support systems of the last 50 years have undermined the need to make them
successful.
One obvious example, which I never cease to regret, is the case of North
Devon Meat. Here we had farmers building an abattoir business in the heart
of a livestock area on a scale capable of trading with any retail outlet in the
country. It became a flagship farmer company, efficiently run, and up to the
highest European standards. Why did it fail? I would hesitate to apportion
blame but farmer apathy must be in large part responsible. I recall attending
AGMs and querying with others the reasons for purchasing cattle from markets
in the north of England for more money than the Company was paying members
locally who delivered direct from farm. Throughput, scale, obtaining ever more
important contracts were the stock answers.
The business eventually foundered, owing farmer members millions of pounds.
Many will remember that emotive meeting in North Devon Meat’s lorry park,
when Peter Mills, the local MP, took over from the retiring Chairman and persuaded us to agree to setting up an interim Board to try to rescue the situation.
Which we did and which succeeded. It took just three years for Percy Browne,
John Quicke and others, including John James and Ralph Human, to turn the
business round and pay off every farmer who was owed money. But it was too
late to recall farmer confidence and the business was sold at a small profit.
And now, years later and after a succession of owners, the abattoir stands
there near Torrington, silent in mothballed splendour, a monument to our failure
to put at least one of those interim directors on the Board before it was too
late. We had done all the hard work, we just relaxed when it really mattered.
The important thing now is to profit from that experience. I have confidence
that newly set up farmer businesses will not be allowed to go under through any
farmer complacency. A recent AGM I attended convinces me of that. There is
a new air of determination abroad in farming today. And the same goes for the
older established co-ops, they will only fail if we allow them to lose touch with
their roots.

Can Devon Outlaw GM?
As an ordinary, fairly ignorant farmer, I am getting fed up with people telling
me how I should or should not produce food on my farm. I am speaking
metaphorically, of course, since decisions of this nature are now made entirely by
my son. But when I started farming, I just got on with the job of producing food
in whatever way I thought was best. If I had believed in farming organically,
then basically the only decision I had to make was whether I could make a living
that way.
I accept that we have come a long way from those days. We produce food
using very complex chemical products, the long term effects of which are difficult, even impossible to predict. There are national and international bodies
to monitor these products and as a farmer I abide by the regulations governing
their use. If I don’t, the law should and does throw the book at me. In practice,
we use very few inorganic or chemical products on our farm, but there are some
we would find it difficult to do without. One obvious example is the liver-fluke
anthelmintics we use for the sheep and cattle on a routine basis, which I don’t
think is allowed under organic rules.
In the last few weeks, there seems to have been a concerted effort by ‘Friends
of the Earth’ and organic farmers to make Devon a GM-free county. This has
produced a predictable reaction from the GM companies represented by the
Agricultural Biotechnology Council. In my opinion, neither side is making a
very convincing case. The antis sound overemotional and ‘Luddite’ and the
pros mainly concerned to protect the financial assets of their technology.
As an ordinary member of the public, I could join the antis, dress up in
a white germ-warfare suit and help prevent the crop trials from taking place.
Or I could unconsciously back the pros and carry on buying the cheapest food,
consistent with taste and freshness, from my local supermarket and rely on some
Government appointed watchdog to ensure that neither I nor the environment
was being poisoned.
However as a farmer it isn’t that simple. I would find it nearly impossible
to bring myself to trash my neighbours’ crops, if they had decided to undertake
a trial. I suppose if I were an organic producer, with my licence threatened,
I might feel differently. For that reason, I could not agree to get involved in
crop trials and jeopardise an organic farmer’s business. To make an informed
judgement, I need to know more, but the hard facts are very difficult to find; I
have looked at the web sites of the various organisations involved and they all
58

Jan 22nd

Can Devon Outlaw GM?

gloss over the actual details. Perhaps I am not looking in the right places but
I am beginning to feel like ‘piggy in the middle’.
It would be helpful to at least have answers to the following questions.
What actual trials have been done on the effects of eating GM plants? I know
that the Soil Association claims that GM maize was only tested on chickens
which had twice the mortality rate of chickens fed organically. Is that really the
only test that has taken place? Who did the test and why was no comparison
done with non-organic maize? What did the chickens die of and how many were
involved in the trial? Am I really to believe that no proper laboratory trials
were done on generations of mice, for instance? Or on pollen eating insects,
which are perhaps more important in the food chain?
We are repeatedly told that GM plants will cross with closely related wild
plants, producing super-weeds. What happens to these super-weeds in subsequent generations? I understood that hybrids tended to be infertile. If not,
why are there not many more non-GM crosses in the wild already? Again, have
there not been proper lab trials done to test this?
The above questions are surely of concern to all of us. Why do they relate
especially to ‘organic’ farming? Are GM-plants in some way inorganic, and if
not, is the Soil Association trying to acquire some extra credentials to which
it is not really entitled? It does not, after all, allow weeds, super or otherwise,
to be sprayed. And are not most of the plants grown by organic farmers the
result of man-made rather than natural plant varieties, if the term natural is
being used to imply ‘organic’ ? OK, perhaps I’m nit-picking, but I am certainly
getting fed up with all the hypothesising. Let’s have some real answers.
And another question to which I would like an answer and this should be
simple - does the County Council actually have the right to outlaw the use of
GM technology in Devon? At some time in the future, can I be denied it here,
while someone 50 miles away in Dorset can use it? Will people here be allowed
to buy milk produced with GM crops, but farmers in Devon restricted from
any competitive advantage? That way may lead to no dairy farmers in Devon.
We’ve been through all this in farming before across national boundaries, I hope
we are not starting it across county borders.
I read that there is a real possibility that bananas may have to be genetically
modified to overcome a fungal disease, which threatens their existence. Instead
of ‘Devon glorious Devon’ might our county anthem then become ‘Yes, we have
no bananas’ ?

Busy Week Off the Farm
The snowdrops and daffodils are already out, it is ridiculously warm and lambing
has started; all good signs that spring may be on the way, although it will
probably be snowing by the time you read this. We are lambing this year
much later than we usually do. With Dorset-cross ewes, we have for many
years lambed in November in order to benefit from the good suck-lamb trade
at Easter. The flock only comes inside at night while lambing and, on our light
land, we have been able to get the lambs fat on grass without supplementary
feeding, and away by February or March. ‘Foot and Mouth’ made a mess of that
system, as we used to leave the ram lambs entire. That year the lambs had to
remain with their mothers until May or June with the inevitable result: a second
crop of lambs appeared in early autumn and the system broke down. I don’t
think people outside farming fully realise the knock-on effect something like an
F&M outbreak can have. Our male beef animals were fattened as young bulls
but during that terrible year these were stuck on the farm months longer than
usual and, as you would expect, became overweight and dangerously boisterous.
All our male calves and lambs are now castrated, an unexpected consequence
for them and for us of a piece of infected imported meat. Anyway Bev, my
daughter-in-law, who manages the sheep, has decided that as the start of the
early suck-lamb trade is not as clearly defined these days, lambing in February
will probably do us just as well.
The last week off the farm has also been an eventful one. On Thursday I
attended the Mole Valley Farmers AGM in South Molton and what a crowded
rumbustious AGM it was. In fact someone sitting behind me remarked at one
point that it was turning into a ‘Brian Rix Farce’, but thankfully it never got
to the trouser-dropping stage. The Directors must have felt they were being
put through the wringer, but at least they know that the shareholders are not
an apathetic bunch who don’t care how their co-operative is being managed. It
is a pity that some other farmer-owned company AGMs have not been so well
attended in the past. Mole Valley has been the biggest farming success story
of the last 40 years and long may it continue. The Directors, past and present,
deserve our considerable thanks for all they do to keep the cost of our farm
inputs down to the minimum, both directly, and indirectly by competing with
other suppliers.
The following evening, Jenny and I attended the Moreton & Chagford NFU
Branch Dinner at Manaton on the edge of Dartmoor. I had never been to
Manaton before and we had a job finding it in the dark. The shortest way was
60

Feb 5th

“Fischler Reforms Are Good News”

not the quickest, especially when you find yourself, after crossing granite-walled
bridges that seemed to touch the sides of our Astra, confronted with a notice
saying the road ahead was unsuitable for wide vehicles. How on earth did they
get that far in the first place? We must go back in daylight - it looks as if
it is one of the rarer places in Devon that is not becoming spoilt by modern
vehicles. We arrived at the dinner a little late, but it was a very pleasant
evening meeting old NFU friends, some from my Crediton Branch-chairman
days. One gets the impression that the farmers on Dartmoor, and I suspect
on Exmoor, still retain that fellowship that comes from them all having very
similar farming businesses. Round here, we are becoming increasingly diverse
in the way we farm. Our immediate neighbours are mostly following their own
particular arable or livestock production methods; perhaps it has the tendency
to break up interest in the local NFU meetings and get-togethers.
And to finish the week off, there was the announcement of the latest farming
deliberations from Brussels - the Mid Term Review. I am sure it is being
written about elsewhere in these pages, so I will leave it to cleverer heads than
mine to outline the details, but one point did catch my eye. There is an item
that states that annual payments of up to £350 per livestock unit ( one adult
cow or seven sheep) will be made to farmers who ‘enter into commitments
for at least 5 years to improve the welfare of their farm animals beyond the
usual good animal husbandry practice’. What on earth do they mean by that?
There has been a jibe about ‘featherbedded farmers’ for years, but this will
change to ‘featherbedded farm animals’. I was amused to see a piece on a TV
news the other day about the terrible conditions on public transport, and the
commentator pointed out, with film, the much better conditions in which farm
animals now travelled. At this rate, our animals will end up living the life of
’Riley’.

February 5th
“Fischler Reforms Are Good News”
I am going to risk becoming extremely unpopular with my fellow farmers, this
week, by saying that the recently announced proposals for reforms to the CAP
are the best news we have had for a very long time. I would go further and
say I believe that, if these reforms can be achieved more or less as they have
been set out, we will look back on 2003 as being as important to us now as the
Agricultural Act of 1947 was to farming then.
Franz Fischler has made it quite clear for some time that he was anxious to
get away from a system that has paid farmers for the number of hectares of corn
61

2003
grown or the headage of sheep and cattle kept on a farm for certain periods of
the year. The idea of a single annual payment for each farm should not have
come as any surprise.
Many of us have been saying for years that production subsidies should
be phased out if we are ever to make farming profitable again. I remember a
farmers’ meeting in the early ’90s when Simon Gourlay, the then NFU President,
was so astonished at a suggestion that we would be well rid of them, that he
asked for a show of hands on the point. Peter Lethbridge, a past County
Chairman, and the last Chairman of the Minister of Agriculture’s Regional
Panel, who had made the suggestion, was supported by a few of us on that
occasion and, since then, I believe many more have come round to this view.
Why then have these latest proposals been received in such a negative way?
The main worry has always been the possibility of an abrupt end to production
subsidies, as happened in New Zealand with the resulting hardship which that
caused. Our existing level of support looks set to continue for at least ten years
ahead, with an eventual reduction of up to 20% for the larger farms to pay for
environmental schemes and reforms of the dairy and sugar sectors. No doubt
the larger farms, currently more profitable in these areas will be as well placed
as any to benefit.
All I have heard at meetings or read about in the farming press so far are
fears of a ‘stitch up’ by the French and Germans, even though Margaret Beckett
has gone on record as saying that she will fight to get a better deal for British
farmers. I hold no particular brief for her - her ministry has not exactly been
a triumph so far, but a bit of positive backing on this occasion instead of the
current negative attitude might not come amiss.
I know there are people who will ask why farming needs any support at
all; other industries once considered essential to the national well-being have
been abandoned to market forces, sometimes with fatal consequences. However
I think it is generally accepted that on a small crowded island like ours, some
form of financial aid towards countryside management must be available, if
food production is to be exposed to direct competition from world markets.
The question is how this rural support is to be paid.
The old deficiency payments system, which served the nation very well by
increasing home food production after the war, did have some serious drawbacks. While encouraging us to expand production with guaranteed prices, it
did absolutely nothing to stimulate us to co-operate together to develop our
marketing. Any increase in market prices across the board would merely have
resulted in lower Government support. We competed with each other - the successful, particularly those with the lowest overheads, expanding and the devil
62

Feb 5th

“Fischler Reforms Are Good News”

taking the hindmost. Which explains why there was a serious explosion of militancy, which split farming opinion in the late ‘60s, by many like us who were
struggling on borrowed capital.
Even the Milk Marketing Board, that supreme example of co-operative marketing did very little to encourage real enterprise with its straight-jacket of State
price control.
The intervention support system that followed, with prices set above production costs, and the consequential and hugely unpopular mountains and lakes
of agricultural produce overhanging the market, was hardly a roaring success
either. And the last few years of IACS forms, measuring hectares of corn to
two decimal points, and counting and accounting for cattle and sheep on certain
days of the year instead of producing what we could sell at a profit has not been
any better.
So why aren’t we cheering from the roof tops. One cheque a year on a fixed
date, with no reason for bungling cross-checking by Government Departments
to cause delay. One visit a year by an official to see that we are actually still
farming, with hopefully a cheque in hand to save postage. And meanwhile, we
can get on and produce what we want to, and concentrate our minds on how
we market it.
I know there is a long way to go before this happy state of affairs arrives, if
ever, but surely it is worth striving for, instead of starting by whinging about
unfairness with our European neighbours. There is a lot of unfairness between
individual farms here at home in the way the proposals have been set out, which
will need correcting.
You are probably thinking that I am enthusiastic because it will suit our
own particular circumstances, but currently with our very extensive stocking
rate of one livestock unit per hectare, we will probably only get half the amount
that an average farm should obtain. Many farms will not qualify at all - dairy,
pig, poultry and horticultural producers for example.
So may I suggest that we welcome the proposals in principle, and concentrate
on ensuring that our three wise monkeys in charge, Beckett, Haskin and Curry,
are left in no doubt about how we, and not some clever-Dick civil servants,
consider the details need to be arranged to make Fischler’s vision a success. For
many of us, it may be the last chance.

“Home Kill Would Improve Welfare”
Last autumn, when Jenny and I were staying with my brother on Vancouver
Island BC, we took the opportunity to visit a neighbouring beef farmer. His
farm is what is known in Canada as a ‘Century’ farm - that is to say it has been
occupied and farmed by the same family for over one hundred years. With a
son working as a farm contractor in Alberta, who was expected to eventually
take over, he seemed quite proud of the designation, although, apart from a
notice at the farm entrance, this does not appear to confer any benefits from
the Canadian government. In fact quite the opposite - the land could not be
developed for anything other than farming and , with sea frontage, the land
on both sides of him was making a lot of money for housing which follows the
coastline of much of the island.
It was not a large farm, only 60 or 70 acres, and the main enterprise was
a herd of about 30 pedigree Charolais cows. With so small a holding, we were
intrigued to find out how he made a reasonable living - he appeared quite
prosperous. The cattle were naturally polled and were not as thickset as our
British Charolais. They also had a slight greyish tinge to their coat-colour,
which made us wonder if there was some Angus blood in their breeding, although
we were tactful enough to refrain from asking. He told us that the foundation
animals had been bought from Mexico, where most of the Canadian Charolais
originated.
That year’s calves, which had just been weaned, were loose housed in a
covered yard to be fattened as 15 month beef. We asked how he marketed the
finished animals; we had seen a notice at his farm entrance advertising organic
beef for sale. He explained that they were all spoken for and he was taking
orders for beef, not yet born, for the following year. What a happy state of
affairs. The organic status was not subject to any registration or inspection
process, and would not have been considered as properly organic in the UK,
although he expected that to change at some time in the future. He wormed
his animals on a routine basis, he thought it would be stupid to do otherwise,
and all his bought-in concentrate feed was non-organic - there was none other
available.
That brought us to the crunch question which is why I am writing about
this now. How did he get his animals slaughtered and butchered ready for sale?
Where was the nearest abattoir? Apparently he had his own humane-killer and
he slaughtered and bled them right there in the shed where we were standing.
He didn’t particularly enjoy it, but he wouldn’t dream of doing otherwise. They
64

were quiet, they knew him well enough to need no restraining and the other
animals were quite undisturbed. He had a small truck in which he could immediately take the whole carcasses, properly hung, to the abattoir, which was
prepared to do the rest of the job, including the all-important disposal of the
offal. He considered that loading them live into a cattle-truck to be an unnecessary hassle, which did nothing for the welfare of the bullocks, and the resulting
stress adversely affected the quality of the beef.
Many farmers here in the UK would, I know, share that view. We have
had to have an animal put down on rare occasions because of illness or injury,
and I have been surprised how the other animals, close by, seem totally unfazed
by the proceedings. Why, therefore, can’t we adopt this method of dealing
with our animals at the end of their lives if we so wish? Until recently, it has
been possible to do this for home consumption, but not if the meat is for sale.
There has been considerable coverage in the media about the plight of mobile
slaughtermen who are being put out of business by the way the law is now being
interpreted, so I won’t go over old ground that has been well covered by the
Western Morning News.
I realise that, at present, any animal whose meat is to be sold, has to have
been slaughtered and processed in a licensed abattoir, where the process can be
monitored by the regulatory authorities. This includes veterinary inspection of
the animal before slaughter for signs of disease and to ensure proper bleeding.
This could as easily be done on the farm and provided the carcass was then
removed to a licensed processing plant, which would not require live animal
facilities, within a specified time and in a proper vehicle, I cannot see how food
safety would be compromised.
Perhaps that is too simple and expense would immediately be cited as the
main difficulty. But you may remember that, a couple of weeks ago, I pointed
out the unexpected proposal in the Reform of the CAP announcement of an
annual grant of up to £325 per livestock unit for improving animal welfare above
the statutory minimum. I was puzzled how such a large sum could be spent
on any one animal in a year. Quite seriously, I now wonder if something along
these lines wouldn’t be the very best way to utilise this money. We might not
be improving animal welfare in their life, but we would certainly improve their
welfare in death.

Fifties Saw Profound Change in Our Way of Life
I enjoyed reading the series of articles by David Prowse last week in the WMN,
recalling his memories of the Fifties. For me, those years evoke far more than
just a nostalgia for one’s youth, they were the beginning of an enormous change
in a farming way of life.
To begin with, in 1950, this farm had no telephone, no mains water, no
electricity, and a road only really fit for a horse and cart (or my motorcycle).
Ten years later, we still had no water or electricity, but we had a telephone - the
unlucky number 13, because that was the only one left in the local exchange,
but at least we could ring for the doctor or the vet. And a car, or rather an old
brown van which doubled up as a milk-churn carrier. The local Council, after
accepting a sum of money equivalent to ten per cent of the value of the farm,
had agreed to maintain the two miles of stone lane that gave access to the farm
- no tarmac, that didn’t come until twenty years later when we persuaded the
Milk Marketing Board to fetch our milk with a milk tanker.
1950 saw the first bathroom and indoor lavatory in the farmhouse and a
water tank in the roof, with hot water thanks to the new Aga. But no way of
getting the water into the tank from the well, without hand pumping, although
this was a ‘too and fro’ hand pump, better than the old ‘up and down’ one,
which just needed to fill a bucket. There were drawbacks - wells in those days
weren’t designed for baths and loos. Townie relatives, staying in the summer,
had a tendency to help by washing up, without realising that rinsing under a
running tap meant no water for evening milking, or a bath, or anything else for
that matter, until the well could recover to the level of the pump’s suction pipe.
For a while, we had a low-voltage electric light plant, but that never came
to much. The petrol engine seemed to need more attention to the carburettor
to get it to start, than the effort of lighting tilley lamps. I think we had a
reliable electric light in the shippon, working off the milking machine engine,
long before the mains arrived in the ‘60s.
Looking back, the advent of electricity in a farmhouse must have been the
greatest single factor in making life half tolerable for a farmer’s wife. When I
think of Jenny bringing up the children, washing the clothes and the nappies
(no disposables then), the house work, helping with the milking and the farm
work, keeping the creditors at bay on the telephone, and putting up with me,
with no help from what we now take for granted like washing machines, vacuum
cleaners, fridges and even the ubiquitous TV, in front of which one can forget
66

Feb 19th

Fifties Saw Profound Change in Our Way of Life

the daily grind for an hour before bed, I doubt the phrase ‘the Golden Years’
is really very appropriate.
Nor was life on the farm all that wonderful compared with today. It is easy
to forget the little things we had to contend with, that on bad days turned into
big things. Does anyone remember the starting handle? We had just got rid of
the horse, which needed feeding, grooming, cleaning out and harnessing before
you could start work, and now we had the tractor which needed a starting
handle. It was one thing to have a machine that was fussy starting on a damp
morning, but to put more manpower into it than it had horsepower, and then
get your thumb dislocated in a moment’s carelessness, is not a happy memory.
Nobody under the age of fifty has experienced that. They probably wouldn’t
know what I meant if I explained about the folly of switching over from petrol
to TVO before the engine was hot enough, and then having to clean the plugs
before starting all over again.
Then there was the little matter of weight lifting - carrying 18 stone sacks
of wheat on your back up stone steps to the granary (granaries were always
up stone steps for some reason). Even fertiliser came in two hundredweight
bags. And what about heaving milk churns onto the milk stand every morning
- I remember feeling for a local dairy farmer who had reached the magnificent
total of producing 30 churns a day. I had a particular back muscle that got
torn at frequent intervals, which did nothing for my temper, but the Health
and Safety Executive has put a stop to all that. Today, we are not allowed to
pick up anything much heavier than a full shopping bag.
I could go on - for instance, hand-hoeing roots and mucking out the shippon
with a wheelbarrow everyday. But of course, there were some good sides to
farming then - no paper work, just the animal movements book, and no interest
on overdue accounts. No supplier would have dreamt of charging interest and
our local miller expected to be paid once a year in early January - that takes a
bit of believing now.
I suppose I enjoy reading about all the things we’ve left behind, but Jenny
prefers not to remember, let alone go back to ‘The Good Old Days’.

Improved NFU Conference
Last week I attended the AGM of the National Farmers Union. Why bother, you
are probably thinking. Isn’t that the farming organisation beloved by the likes
of ‘One man and his dog’ Robin Page and ‘I’m paid too much subsidy’ barleybaron Oliver Walston, and the darling of environmentalists, small farmers and
disgruntled members of the rural community generally? Well, yes - that’s the
one and I confess I’ve been pretty critical of it myself on numerous occasions.
But I reckon I’m entitled to criticise - I’ve been a paid up member of the NFU
for over 50 years, which is more than can be said of Messrs Page and Walston.
I am a great believer in the principle of attending AGMs unless completely
satisfied with the conduct of the society, co-op or group one belongs to. I
can probably claim to have attended as many NFU AGMs as any non-council
member farmer alive, and that isn’t saying much. Until the 1970s, you had to
be an official delegate to be allowed in at all. I well remember being barred
entry at the doors of Westminster Central Hall, until the then President, Sir
Henry Plumb, generously sent out word that I could sit in the press gallery,
provided I kept my mouth shut.
In the years that followed, ordinary members were allowed to attend and
speak, but with the meetings taking place at 9 a.m. in some swank West End
Hotel, it was not really economic for those of us living any distance out of
London to get there without staying overnight. Last year, the AGM took place
at noon, which was a step in the right direction, and this year, at long last, the
meeting and conference moved to Warwickshire, just down the road from the
Royal Show Ground, and out of London for the first time.
So it was that I set off early by car for what I think ought to be my last AGM.
I am, after all, a little past my prime, and I actually sat through the meeting
without once opening my mouth, the first time since sitting in the press gallery
all those years ago. But I’m glad I went; it is evident that the NFU is slowing
changing course, like some giant container ship where the rudder is applied
some miles before any change in direction can be detected. A resolution was
passed, virtually unanimously, for a radical overhaul of the way the Union is
managed. An amendment was even proposed to allow members a direct vote
for the presidency, but that was one step too far this time. I sometimes think
members forget that the Council, which elects the President, is no longer a
self perpetuating cabal, but is itself properly elected by a postal ballot of all
members. Let’s hope that the changes that are needed will be pushed through
quicker than in the past.
68

Mar 5th

Non-burial Lunacy

And we sure do need a vigorous and well-supported NFU right now. We
have no other organisation big enough to be capable of ensuring that reform
of the CAP, which Commissioner Fischler in his speech to the meeting appears
determined to achieve, will be implemented fairly and be of lasting benefit to
European agriculture. It is time the CAP ceased to be an object of derision.
I enjoy listening to Franz Fischler, he got quite emotional and even humorous
during questions on this occasion - perhaps that is to be expected, he is a farmer
after all. Which is more than can be said for our farm minister, Margaret
Beckett, who was the first speaker. I have been inclined to give her a little more
credit lately, in comparing her with her predecessors, but I went right off her
this time. She had the gall to describe her three most exemplary farmers of
the year who she thought were adapting best to the future - one was going in
for charcoal production from hitherto untouched deciduous woodland, another
had converted farm buildings to livery stables and the third was converting to
‘organic’. Very commendable I’m sure, but if that is how she sees the way for
mainstream farming, I really wonder what the demonstration farms she told us
she was setting up, will be demonstrating.
Reflecting on the day as I motored home, I felt reasonably optimistic. The
change of venue had not prevented the top farm politicians from attending,
there seemed to be more non-delegate members present than usual and it had
been the easiest and cheapest annual meeting for me to get to. I noticed a huge
flock of starlings, in the thousands, wheeling in the evening sky on its way to
roost as I passed Evesham, which will cheer the bird-lovers among us. We must
be doing something right if we are providing enough food for that lot; I keep
reading that starlings, like sparrows are in terminal decline. The motorway food
was another story. I had a quick breakfast on the way up and a quick supper
on the way home, and the food was expensive and pretty revolting; I can just
about tolerate either but not both. A pity a few farmers don’t diversify into
motorway catering. We might just get a half-decent meal.

March 5th
Non-burial Lunacy
Lambing is more or less over for this year, with just the usual few stragglers left.
It has been a good lambing according to Bev, my daughter-in-law, who manages
the sheep flock. We have had more doubles than usual and the majority are
strong enough now to be away up on the mowing grass where hopefully they
will stay till they are ready for sale, or, if it is a late spring, until those fields
are shut up for silage and hay. I don’t know the exact count, but doubtless Bev
69

2003
has the totals in her flock register. I remember when it was considered unlucky
to count the lambs until they were tailed, which was done at a month old with
a sharp knife and no local anaesthetic. The tails were then counted instead of
the lambs, I suppose to avoid ‘counting your chickens..’. Times change, and for
the better for the lambs, but they are about to change again. No more on-farm
burial or burning. What are we going to do with the few stillborn lambs or the
odd weakly one that doesn’t make it past the first few days?
A few losses are quite inevitable and, new-born lambs being very small, are
easily and quickly disposed of. We have always preferred to bury any animal
we have had the misfortune to lose, rather than employ a knacker service with
the attendant risk of bringing disease onto the farm. When we started farming
here, a number of our dairy cows died from Johne’s disease, which was caused,
I later discovered, from contact with an apparently healthy and productive
foundation cow, which never itself succumbed. For a period of about five years,
we lost two or three cows a year from a small herd of fifteen which we were
trying to expand. It was a very depressing experience and, had I not been so
pigheaded, should have ended my career. Probably the worst part was digging
the inevitable grave. We employed no help in those early days, and, without a
tractor digger which we have now, I faced the daunting task on each occasion
of hand-digging a very large hole. However, there was a bright side to this
melancholy tale. Jenny took advantage of my efforts with a devon-shovel, an
unfamiliar tool with which I soon became a dab hand, and started a shrubbery
on the site. We beat the disease, with help from the MAFF veterinary service,
and the trees did very well. The dairy herd did eventually reach 85 cows and
we have a mini arboretum to show for the delay.
BSE has quite correctly put a stop to all burials of adult cattle for some
years now, but after May 1st we will not be allowed to bury anything at all. I
am inclined to blame the French for the Commissions determination to make
this a European-wide regulation; it was common knowledge that BSE in France
was jokingly called JCB disease. It is reasonable to make sure we can account
for all cattle deaths, especially as it seems we may soon be relaxing the over-30
month scheme. It would otherwise be possible for an unscrupulous individual
to get a supposedly buried animal into the food chain, and with BSE cases
now rapidly declining, the last thing we want is any investigative TV reporter
looking for a lurid story.
However, when we start looking at the mechanics of collecting every single
animal that dies on a farm, I really wonder what sort of world these bureaucrats
who govern us live in. Do they really expect us to somehow get any new
born dead lamb, piglet or even calf collected quickly by a national knacker
70

service, which is patently not equipped to operate such a scheme, never mind
the expense. It is already illegal for us to move dead animals ourselves off the
farm to an incinerator. So inevitably we will have the smaller dead animals
lying around for days until they can be removed. Is that what the authorities
want and why have they left it so late to get things organised? Surely it is
their responsibility to ensure we can obey what is a stupid regulation, taken
to this extreme. Being cynical, I wonder how many stillborn lambs there will
be in flocks that are not due to lamb until after May 1st. DEFRA’s web site
states that, although no agreement has been reached with the industry on the
operation of a national collection scheme, the regulation will be enforced from
that date. Without any direct communication from DEFRA so far about a
possible phasing in period, I have to assume that if I fail to bury a sheep on
April 30th, I am liable to prosecution, but if I bury the said sheep on May 1st, I
have again broken the law. Come on DEFRA, get your act together. Meanwhile
Jenny is planting a Snowdrop tree on the grave of our old sheepdog, Sammy,
who died last autumn. It may grow in splendid isolation to remind us of the
loss of farming common sense.

Growing crops or park keeping? Does the nation really know what it wants from
farmers in the future? To find out, I went last week to the launch in Tiverton
of the Pilot of the new ‘Broad and Shallow’ or ‘Entry Level Agri-Environment’
Scheme, as it is now called. This is to be the first step towards paying farmers
for the work they have traditionally done as they go about their everyday job
of producing food. If it wasn’t such a sensitive metaphor, I might be tempted
to equate it to the necessary work of painting the walls and cleaning the floor
of an industrial factory. The Curry Report, set up to point the way ahead for
farming after the ‘foot and mouth’ disaster, put forward the idea, among others,
that support for agriculture should progressively switch from production to the
environment. This new scheme is the first result of that and is to be tested
during the next two years to see how it might work in practice.
There are to be four pilot areas nationally, each representing a particular
type of farming. An area just west of Tiverton, roughly seven miles square, has
been chosen to test the scheme for grassland farming. Although we ourselves
farm just outside the area, it seemed a good opportunity to go to the launch
and see how it might affect us when it is rolled out nationally.
71

2003
The meeting was well attended - there must have been nearly 150 people
present. There were three main speakers. David Fursden, a Devon farmer and
the Deputy President of the Country Landowners Association nationally, set
out the background to the present farming situation into which this new scheme
must be made to fit, and put very forcefully the vital point that without profit
returning to farming, this would all be a wasted opportunity.
John Sheaves, our own regional manager of FWAG who is one of the architects of the scheme, then outlined, in some detail, how it will work in practice,
particularly in relation to this area of Devon. He went on to explain the long
term objectives, which, if I may put it very simply, is the hope that a joined-up
approach to environmental support will encourage most, if not all farmers to
participate. Individual attempts to look after the countryside, however well
managed, do not achieve the overall result that the public are increasingly
demanding, nor do they allow wildlife in all its forms to expand and contract
naturally as climate and human pressure dictates. From 2005, the current Stewardship Scheme and Environmentally Sensitive Areas will be abandoned, to be
replaced with a new ‘narrow and deep’ agri-environment scheme, as a higher
tier based on this Entry Level scheme. This jargon is theirs, not mine. I hope
by the time it all happens, a nice simple descriptive title will have evolved which
everyone, town and countryside alike, can understand. And for it to happen,
the four pilots have to be successful.
Mike Izzard, DEFRA’s manager of our Tiverton pilot, then took us through
the inevitable paper work that will be required to join, and also outlined the
amount of officialdom that an experimental scheme will involve, which hopefully
appears fairly minimal. As you would expect, there were many questions from
the floor, but we came away from what I thought was a good well-constructed
meeting with my only complaint the poor acoustics - I had difficulty hearing
both the speakers and the questioners, perhaps I am getting old.
Naturally enough, my immediate interest was to see how easily we would
qualify, had we been in the area. The scheme takes the form of a number of
options, 45 all told, which describe various forms of environmental management,
with a points value for each option. The guidance booklet works entirely in
‘hectares’, as you would expect today; in fact I don’t think the word ‘acre’
occurs anywhere in the 80 pages. However, since I still see area in ‘acres’, I will
stick to the old measurements; it is fortunate that yards and metres are not too
dissimilar. It was obvious straight away that we were in, using mainly one of
the 45 options - hedgerow management. To qualify, a lowland farm needs to
tot up 12 points an acre for the total area of the farm, woods and all, and for
that earns £12 an acre, no more no less. So long as that basic score is achieved
72

Mar 19th

Retired Vet Fills Breach

there is no financial gain in going any further. Some of the options do require
considerable effort or loss of production, especially on the arable side, but are
worth a lot of points, so that small areas can accumulate sufficient to average
out over the whole farm.
In our case, a quick calculation, using our IACS maps, of the total length of
all our hedges, worth just under 30 points per 100 yards, showed that we were
well over our required points score. Our fields average just under 10 acres, and
are virtually all surrounded by hedgerows rather than fences. I am pretty sure
that most of the farms in the pilot, unless their field size is substantially larger,
will qualify as easily on the same basis. The management required is also very
straight forward, trim every other year on a rotational basis, and leave three feet
from the base of the hedge uncultivated as a buffer from farming operations.
We more or less do that already and so do many other farmers.
This won’t produce the wild flower meadows and sweet smelling hay fields
so evocatively recalled by our nostalgic commentators recently, but, as John
Sheaves put it, we will, if we all do it together, greatly increase from the
hedgerows alone the available food supply and habitat for many of our farmland
insects, birds and small mammals. And hopefully we can build the rest from
there.

March 19th

We have finally had our herd TB test. I say finally as, like many other farms in
Devon, the test is long overdue. We are on a two-year testing basis, but due to
the ‘Foot and Mouth’ outbreak, it has been over four years since our previous
test. Although the hassle is not something we look forward to, the possibility
of TB spreading through the cattle over that length of time, is very worrying.
There has been the odd reactor in neighbouring parishes recently, but we are
fortunately in a healthy area and have never had a case in all the fifty years we
have farmed here. However, there is always a first time.
We were somewhat taken aback in January to be informed by the DEFRA
Animal Health Division in Exeter that a standstill order would be imposed on us
by the end of March, if our vet had not completed our herd test by then. Many
other farmers have received the same rather terse notice. I know the veterinary
practices in the county have been run off their feet, trying to catch up with
the backlog, but it is the Ministry’s job to get things sorted. I understand that
their part-time veterinary staff has been cut to a minimum, which seems very
short-sighted in view of the seriousness of TB in the south west. In the past,
73

2003
our own vets were not normally employed to do this work. It is, after all, a
notifiable disease for which the Ministry is responsible.
In our case, the cavalry came to the rescue in the form of Andrew Turnbull,
one time Divisional Veterinary Officer for Devon, now retired, who has been
recruited by our own vet to fill the breach. The cows were persuaded through
the cattle-crush as reluctantly as usual; they never like a herd test, for some
reason - waving their heads about as if the skin-deep tuberculin jabs in the
neck are a lethal injection. The blood sample for the Bruscellosis test which
was also needed this time, is collected from the underside of the base of the tail,
with far less stress to the animal. It used to be necessary for the vet to check
the ear tattoo or small metal eartag to insure correct identification, so that a
neck site for the skin measurement was perhaps easiest, but with modern large
distance tags, this is no longer the case. Why not do the skin measurements
on the rump, as I am told they do in Australia? The cattle would certainly go
through the crush better, if the vet was not standing in front.
Better still, why can’t we start using the TB blood test, which is available
now, to allow both diseases to be checked from a single blood sample? I know
that the TB blood test is supposed to throw up more false positives than the
skin test, but the actual testing would be quicker and easier and there would be
no need for a return visit three days later to measure the skin reactions. If, as I
suspect, we are going to end up testing all cattle annually to get this wretched
disease under control again, a single blood test would be much the simplest
option. If it is also more sensitive, the false positives might be worthwhile. In
any case, I have often heard, from fellow farmers, of cases where the skin test
also produced reactors which showed no sign of infection on post mortem.
The return visit went without a hitch, quickly enough to satisfy even as
senior a vet as Mr Turnbull, and thankfully with no reactors. The Brusellosis
result we shall have to wait for, but I would be very surprised if any animal fails
that. I know there have been a few cases in the north from animals imported
from Ireland, but the UK seems to have been relatively free for many years.
When I started farming, it was a terrible scourge if it got a hold in a herd.
I can remember one of my fellow college graduates, who started farming in
Hampshire, being virtually wiped out by the persistent abortions in his dairy
herd and finally admitting defeat and giving up farming altogether. And it
didn’t do the vets any good either; I think they all contracted undulant fever
at some time in their careers, which left them with malaria type symptoms for
rest of their days.
If TB is spreading into areas which have been clear in recent years, as seems
to be happening, the quicker we get the testing regime back to normal the
74

better. I know the badger situation is a very emotive subject to both farmers
and environmentalists alike, but the last thing we want is to spread TB into
badger populations in clean areas. Infecting badgers inadvertently through the
movement of infected cattle will only store up trouble for the future. With our
cattle clear after four years, I am pretty confident that our badgers, and we have
plenty of them on the farm, are clear also. I wouldn’t want any badger-slaughter
programme round these parts, allowing infected badgers to spread into vacant
territory.

March 26th
Let’s Hope This War Is Over Soon
Last Thursday, waking up earlier than usual at half past five, I came down to
make a cup of tea and turn on the radio to listen to Farming Today. I have never
been an early riser, unless occasion demands, so it is not a programme which
I hear very often. I wasn’t much put out, therefore, to find the programme
cancelled at short notice by reports of the opening shots in the Iraq war - cruise
missiles launched at Baghdad during the night from British submarines in the
Gulf.
As I sit there, not really listening to the excited voices of the commentators,
it strikes me that this is one of those occasions that will stick in the memory
for years to come. For me, no ‘Farming Today’, but for Iraqi farmers, what of
tomorrow, how will a war affect them? I don’t know much about farming there,
but I assume the land between the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers to be fertile
and food producing - where the Garden of Eden is supposedly located.
I imagine the havoc a modern army fighting its way across the Devon countryside would cause as springtime unfolds, and our current worries about farm
pollution, Nitrate Vulnerable Zones and on-farm burial fade into insignificance.
I just hope Iraqi farmers suffer no more than the noise of cruise missiles as they
pass overhead.
That takes me back, not unnaturally, to my time as a schoolboy experiencing
something very similar, but on a much smaller scale. Anyone my age who was
living in Surrey during the war will remember the V1s or doodle bugs, as they
were known. I can clearly recall sitting in a large hall with about 50 other boys,
doing our school certificate exams. A doodle bug would be heard approaching
with its very recognisable stuttering engine, and, as the noise cut out, we would
all look up and wait the minute or so until we heard a ‘crump’ as it pitched
to earth and exploded, before going back to our writing. It was said that if
you heard one coming, you were safe, as it always glided beyond earshot, before
75

2003
coming down. If it was going to get you, you wouldn’t hear it at all. As boys,
we were strangely unafraid - youthful optimism, no doubt. We saw and heard
plenty of them, day and night. There was a school joke doing the rounds that
one had been seen flying so low, it had come in through a window on one side
of a boys dormitory and out through a window the other side. I only once saw
where one had exploded. I was cycling home very early on a Sunday morning
and I found myself carrying my bike the length of a village street, which was
covered in glass from the shop windows on either side. The owners were standing
in their doorways in dressing gowns surveying the damage. The doodle bug had
come down in the village churchyard, and I wondered if anyone would be going
to church that Sunday.
War was still very evident, when I first came to Devon. I remember large
areas in the centre of Exeter were flat open spaces, which had been levelled
following the bombing, and were awaiting redevelopment. Parking in the centre
of the city has never been so easy since.
Even on this farm, in as rural a place as you could wish, it is still possible
to find traces of those times, if you know where to look. The sites of a gun
emplacement, searchlight and accompanying living quarters are still obvious.
One night two Halifax bombers on a training flight just clipped each other over
Morchard Bishop, one coming down in one of our hedgerows and the other a
mile away, I believe, in a swede field. There was one survivor out of fourteen
crew members, the occupants of the second plane attempting to parachute too
late, and only found early the next morning by a local farm worker. Although
both planes were carefully removed, small bits of alloy and perspex remain in
our hedge bank to this day.
We ploughed up six incendiary bombs when we were reclaiming a brackeny
brake in the 1960s. They looked like spent alloy shells. One got tossed carelessly
into a large brushwood bonfire by the chap helping me, exploding in a flash of
green phosphorous flame and fortunately only badly singeing his eyebrows and
hair. They were part of a stick that was dropped one night on the neighbour’s
Elizabethan thatched farmhouse. He was apparently notoriously lax with his
blackout precautions. The two ruined wings of the house, now used as farm
buildings, are all that remain to show for a night’s hectic activity with bucketchains from the farm pond. There is also a slight depression on that farm
to show where a spitfire crashed after losing an overhead dogfight, the Czech
airman parachuting safely and carried back on a gate with only a broken leg.
There must be many such reminders of that war scattered on farms throughout the county, but nothing to compare with the burnt-out and rusting wreckage
76

that will be strewn across Iraq. I just hope for the sake of those Iraqi farmers
that this war will be over quickly.

April 2nd
Heifers Go to Market Too Early
With all that is happening in Iraq, it seems almost an affront to write about day
to day life on the farm. It is looking as if the war is not going to be the quick
campaign we all hoped for. The never ending coverage on TV is starting to get
to me; I find myself switching off almost immediately, which sounds heartless
when people are dying, but life has to go on.
March came in like a lamb, and at odds with the old saying, is quietly going
out like a lamb. It has been one of the best months of March I can remember.
The winter corn and most of the grass ground has been top-dressed and rolled
and, if we get some rain during April, the year will be looking promising. How
often do we say that and bring a drought or deluge around our necks?
During the week, we sent off ten fat heifers to slaughter - and fat most of
them were. We don’t find it easy to get heifers big enough but not over fat under
30 months old, especially indoors through the winter. Ours is a crossbred herd
of Charolais and Limousin cows, with a Simmental and Angus bull at present
as the terminal sires. We farm very extensively, and our beef would under
normal circumstances be mature and ready to eat when nearer three years old
or even older. The announcement by the Foods Standards Agency that the
‘Over Thirty Months Scheme’ is being reviewed, with the possibility of allowing
older animals into the food chain, is therefore very good news indeed for us
suckler beef producers.
BSE, which was predominately a dairy cattle disease, has hit beef farmers
disproportionately hard. There is no doubt in my mind that it was triggered
by the 1976 drought in America which affected the soya harvest that year. UK
dairy herds were heavily dependant on soya bean meal for the protein element
in dairy rations. The quantities of meat and bone meal which had also been
used in cattle rations (including organic cattle rations) for almost 100 years,
were increased to make up the shortfall. So much is fact. How this caused BSE
is still largely supposition, although there is no doubt that the recycling of meat
and bone meal through the national herd produced the explosion in cases.
My theory, which admittedly is based on our own slight experience as dairy
farmers at that time, is that it was mainly young dairy calves which became
infected when weaned early and fed rations containing an excess of m&b meal,
as all calf rations then were. That is how modern dairy farming works; long
77

2003
gone are the days when we allowed the calf to drink it’s fill before taking any
surplus for human consumption. Suckler beef production, however, does still
operate very largely as it always has done. Calves suckle naturally for up
to a year, or until the cow calves again, and are not normally encouraged to
eat concentrate rations at an early age. Under those conditions, BSE which,
like encephalopophies in all species, has probably always existed in cattle at a
minuscule level, would never have become the horrendous epidemic which we
ended up with. In fact we would probably still be feeding meat and bone meal
today, and certainly using it as a natural fertiliser, which is how we should
always have used it, instead of having to dispose of it at enormous expense.
It seems incongruous, therefore, that suckler beef producers, of all farmers,
should have been most heavily penalised by the various preventative measures
which were quite correctly put in place. Not only have we had to intensify
our management to get our animals saleable younger, we have also lost out on
the very substantial part of our income which the quality of our older breeding
animals produced as beef for burgers and pies, when they reached the end of
their lives.
I am not trying to drive a wedge between beef and dairy farmers - we are
all in this together, but I hope as the OTM Scheme is unravelled, it is done so
with more consideration than when it was imposed. I well recall the campaign
we had to undertake to get the grossly unfair weight limit belatedly removed,
a regulation brought in by a completely ignorant newly appointed Agriculture
Minister trying to save a little money for the Treasury.
In the interest of the very fragile beef market, the unravelling needs to be
done progressively and not in one jump, with all cattle, whatever their ages
suddenly allowed into the food chain. The individual testing of every animal
will be a considerable expense anyway, which will no doubt be foisted onto
the industry. If a birth date from which all cattle can be marketed is sensibly
decided on, we can ourselves to some extent regulate supplies. Many of us will
I am sure keep our animals for over thirty months for economic reasons which
will initially help reduce oversupply. I know the ten heifers we sold last week
would still be on our farm now. No doubt the Chancellor of the Exchequer will
ultimately decide, with saving ‘his’ money as the only criteria. Which takes us
back to the war in Iraq, and the expense which that is incurring.

Twaddle in 2020 Report

April 9th
Twaddle in 2020 Report
I was intending to write about something quite different this week, but two
items in the papers recently caught my attention and I can’t let them pass
without comment.
The first was the news that the French had been fined £11 million by the
European Commission over their illegal ban on British beef. There were quotes
from farming leaders and MPs on the derisory amount and the fact that the
French Government had been effectively let off millions of pounds in fines for
their delay in lifting the ban. It is unfortunately too late to make much difference to the many farmers who have suffered through the poor price for beef
in recent years. The systems for enforcing Community regulations have got to
be tightened up as a matter of priority - something for our MEPs to get their
teeth into,(that is if they have any, which is probably the root of the problem).
What really struck me about this item of news, however, was the fact that
six French farming unions collaborated to break the law. Actually it was stated
that four of the unions were representing farmers, and the other two were representing slaughterers, who were coerced under the threat of violence from the
farmers. Now I know French farmers are a militant bunch, at the best, or should
I say worst of times, but this really takes ones breath away. Is that the end of
it and do these unions now carry on as if nothing has happened?
I bring this up because, years ago, we organised a one-week boycott of livestock markets. When I say ‘we’, I mean the Devon NFU. I seem to remember
the idea was taken up nationally, but it was only 100% effective here in the
South West. There was very little damage to any businesses outside farming,
and it certainly did not interfere with the national food supply. We just wanted
to make a point to Government and the general public. At the time the NFU
was warned that if ever anything like that was tried again, NFU funds would
immediately be frozen and the heavy weight of the law would be rolled into motion. And the threat apparently still hangs over us 25 years later, as I have often
been reminded. I’ll bet those French unions have shrugged off their fines with
an immediate increase in membership from a grateful farming community, that
is if membership of the French farming unions is not ‘voluntarily’ compulsory.
The other item that caught my eye was the “State of the Countryside 2020”
report by the Countryside Agency. Again I won’t go into the detail, which I
am sure you will have seen, but one statement did annoy me. It was in relation
to the inevitable increase in the number of people coming to live down here
and the possibility that this will mark the passing of England’s ‘green and
79

2003
pleasant land’. What a load of twaddle. No doubt the Countryside Agency, a
Government quango if ever I saw one, is comprised of distinguished, clever and
well meaning appointees, but this kind of talk really gets us nowhere.
I spent my teenage years in Surrey, and I remember exactly what it was
like in those days. When I was there it was known as the stockbroker belt,
with wealthy businessmen, who could afford the upkeep, living in the ancient
farmhouses and commuting to London three days a week. Many of the working
farmers had moved into comfortable, up-to-date houses, where at least you could
stand straight without banging your head on an Elizabethan beam. Going back
to my old haunts now, which I occasionally do, I can see what 50 years of
population growth has done. Yes, there are changes which make me wince. The
farm where I got my first job, hay-making with horses, has changed out of all
recognition, although horses are still the motive power. When I worked there,
it was 120 acres of hay meadows, hedges, ditches and ponds. It is now one flat
featureless expanse of grass, a polo ground owned by a pop-star - I think the
drummer of the Rolling Stones. But that is very much the exception. Surrey
is still the most densely tree-covered county in England and the countryside is
just as green and pleasant as before. The farmers, on the whole, look a damn
sight more prosperous than they do down here. Undoubtedly farming there is
not the most important part of the local economy, and there are too many cars
for my liking, but it’s called progress and you can’t stop it. It’s been happening
since the 18th century and at least now it is reversing a trend.
150 years ago, the three miles of lane where we are, used to comprise eight
small farms with their attendant families living here. Parcels of land were even
farmed by tenants who lived elsewhere. The footpaths were used daily by people
going to work. It was a ‘populated’ green and pleasant land. And fortunately
the new people who are moving in now are more concerned about keeping it
like that than those of us who have been struggling to make a living off this
land in recent years.

April 16th
Banality of “Essential” Pamphlets
We had our annual FABBL inspection recently. For the uninitiated, FABBL
stands for ‘Farm Assured British Beef and Lamb’ and is one of the many farm
assurance schemes which farmers are almost compulsorily obliged to join these
days. From April 1st this year, the FABBL standards have been revised, which
inevitably means expanded, and since our inspection was to take place on the
80

Apr 16th

Banality of “Essential” Pamphlets

7th, I found myself going through all the paper work to see what new rules we
had to meet.
The most significant change appeared to be the requirement to have a number of Ministry pamphlets available for inspection in the farm office, I suppose
to indicate that we just might have read them. Unfortunately I had thrown
ours away as being out of date. A quick phone call to get them replaced only
produced two of the five needed, the others were temporarily unavailable. Too
many farmers on the same trail? I read the two in hand hoping that a good
knowledge of their contents might mitigate for the lack of the other three. My
main job these days is, after all, management of the farm paper work, and I am
not quite ready for my son to decide that I am not even up to that job.
I shouldn’t have bothered. The two we had covered the welfare of sheep, 25
pages, and the protection of air, 75 pages. I suppose if you had never looked after
sheep in your life before, the sheep one might be useful, but to any sheep farmer
of my acquaintance, it was patronising to a degree. For instance, the paragraph
on foot management starts with the sentence “Lameness in any animal is usually
an indication of pain”. I looked to see if there was any ‘indication’ as to who
had written this ‘stuff’ that we were obliged to retain as a kind of farming bible.
I found that the flyleaf states that these livestock welfare codes are only issued
once they have been approved by both Houses of Parliament. That explained
a lot. I shan’t be in any hurry to read the cattle pamphlet when we eventually
get it.
The booklet on air protection - it is really too long to call a pamphlet - is
again basically common sense. A couple of examples, which I am sure our MPs
nodded their heads at sagely when agreeing to their inclusion, are “odours from
spreading manures and slurries can be smelt a long distance from the field”
and, ten pages further on, “if slurry is frequently agitated in store there will be
a frequent release of odours”. Words of wisdom indeed. I am looking forward
to seeing what gems I can find in ‘Protection of Water’ and ‘Protection of Soil’
when they too are delivered by our long suffering postman.
The inspection itself went reasonably smoothly. Jim had made sure that the
keys to the padlocks on the cupboards where we keep medicines and eartags
were to hand. The cattle were all looking well fed and happy, and obviously
enjoying the ‘Five Freedoms’ they are entitled to - hardly surprising since we
have at present only about half the number of animals which the buildings were
designed for. If beef production becomes profitable again, that may need closer
inspection. The ewes and lambs were all out at pasture looking flourishing,
with the odd lame one gallantly hiding for our benefit. Its a strange fact that
normally if sheep are inspected, particularly if a television crew are at hand,
81

2003
any lame ewe will always stand in front of the flock with a leg raised to show
what a rotten shepherd is in charge of her.
There was one slight blot on our escutcheon which Derek, our inspector,
pointed out when checking our feed storage facilities. Sparrows could get at the
crumbs left behind where we bag up the rolled corn under our roller mill. We
installed a second-hand grain silo a couple of years ago, which is proof against
birds, to replace the heap in the barn which had to be sheeted down to prevent
any soiling by our, quite healthy, sparrow population. The fact that sparrows,
and all the other birds which feed on grain, make free with our crops in the
fields before harvest is, I suppose, something which MPs will have to worry
about in the future. Meanwhile, I shall have to resort to feeding our sparrows
a few handfuls of rolled barley every day through the winter, to avoid censure
from our own Trevor Beer.
The final inspection, the farm paperwork - animal movement book, herd
records and medicines books - went without a hitch. Hardly surprising since
this was their third inspection by officialdom so far this year. One interesting
point, which Derek made, concerned the local anaesthetic which we used to use
to disbud the calves horns. Apparently it is the ‘local’ used by dentists, but
the company manufacturing it sells such a small proportion of their production
for animal use, that it was not economic to take out the necessary licence. In
practice, what is good enough for humans is not good enough for animals. Ah
well, that sounds like the ‘transport regulations’ all over again!
So for another year, our beef and lamb can be sold with a little ‘Red Tractor’
on the label. Will we be paid anymore as a result? That is something to write
about another day.

April 23rd
Thundering Over Times Opinions
One of our farming neighbours, Jim Stephens, dropped by the other evening
with a cutting from a recent edition of The Times newspaper. He was obviously
somewhat put out by an article written by the Times Environment Editor,
Anthony Browne and headed ‘Your country needs you: don’t buy British’.
I must admit that my first impression was that it was a semi-humorous
put-down of the newly launched campaign to publicise ‘farming’ to the nation.
Describing the farming lobby as ‘The NFU and assorted acolytes in the muckspreading industry’ did seem a trifle rich coming from a journalist, although
perhaps I am thinking of the word ’muckraking’ when I say that, but the general
82

Apr 23rd

Thundering Over Times Opinions

drift did seem the sort of urban view of subsidised agriculture which I presume
the campaign is hoping to correct.
However a couple of glasses of wine later and after Jim had returned home, I
reread the article more carefully. By the time I had finished, I was gently steaming as well. Anthony Browne says that subsidised farming is an ’economically
insignificant industry of mass destruction, not just wiping out most of our natural habitat, poisoning the land with pesticides, ploughing up hedgerows and
killing off badgers, but also decimating the economies of the world’s poorest
countries’.
Well, I accept that we have now become economically insignificant when
measured against the national GDP. I would have thought, that since we produce two thirds of the nations food, this is in itself a remarkable achievement.
Even if the subsidy element of producing food is included, doesn’t it prove that
the amount we spend on food is proportionately smaller now than at any time
in our history? It is also probably less than anywhere else in the world, with the
exception of the US. The only surprising thing about that is the extraordinarily
profitable balance sheets produced by multinational supermarkets that actually
retail that food to the public.
As for wiping out our natural habitat, that is surely what farming is all
about, wherever in the world it is carried out. The alternative is going back to
‘hunter gathering’ or forward to eating food produced completely synthetically
in a factory - no doubt where we shall end up in two or three hundred years
time. Ploughing up the hedgerows is a strange stick to beat us with, since we
put them there in the first place, to help us wipe out the natural habitat. In fact
they were greeted with considerable resistance at the time of the ‘enclosures’
for denying ordinary people access to the countryside, to collect the wild fruits
and dead wood which was everybody’s right. And the ‘killing off’ of poor old
badgers referred to really is a pathetic red herring not worthy of a reputable
environment editor of any newspaper. We have more badgers around now than
at any time since ‘Doomsday’. You only have to count the number we kill
annually with our motorcars. Farmland is one glorious feeding ground for a
fully protected species with no natural predator. And what a predator it is,
itself, of all the other wildlife that breeds or feeds at ground level.
Which takes me to the accusation that we are decimating the economies
of the worlds poorest nations. And here I am on tricky ground. I simply
don’t know if that is true. We are told by the World Bank that by slashing
farm subsidies we would be helping to relieve Third World poverty. Anthony
Browne states that Kenya, Egypt and Uganda want nothing more than to sell
us green beans and mange-tout. I was not aware that the rich nations subsidise
83

2003
green beans and mange-tout. He says that eating bananas keeps African and
Caribbean economies afloat. I thought we already ate vast quantities of bananas, we don’t produce bananas and without subsidies will we eat any more?
Leaving aside the questions of food security, food miles and food quality, if we
did give up buying British, are we really going to make the Third World any
richer? I presume the developing countries are also concerned with food security, if nothing else. And if the experience of farmers here is anything to go by,
it will be the multinational food companies of the West who will do the retailing
and their share holders who will end up the richer.
Finally, Anthony Browne suggests that when others do our farming, we can
let our man-made countryside go back to the landscape of our ancestors - we
can have our woodlands back. I am not sure which ancestors he wants to go
back to. Does he see himself as some latter day Robin Hood, or knight of the
Round Table or Boadicea’s warrior playing golf in the forest clearings? He says
he would give our subsidy ‘millions’ to the RSPB and the Woodland Trust to
really protect the natural habitat, which he thinks farmers are not doing now.
Well I’ve got news for him. If we all step back for 100 years and leave nature
to take it’s course, we’ll have natural scrub woodland from Land’s End to John
O’Groats. And quite apart from the monotony of that habitat, we shan’t see
the view for the trees.

April 30th
Will Carp Ponds Be Banned?
Rain at last. All the newspaper talk of another ‘76’ drought being on the way,
seems to have done the trick. It’s very strange how often it happens. There
only has to be the most dire predictions of some weather catastrophe, and it’s
all change immediately. I reckon there was more to ‘rain dancing’ by the North
American Indians than met the eye! We have thankfully had a decent amount
and we certainly needed it. This is a very dry farm; we seem to be in the rain
equivalent of a frost pocket - it can be raining hard in the village three miles
away in catchy weather and we don’t get a drop. We can’t have too much
during April and May.
The other thing to be grateful for last week was the letter from DEFRA outlining how the ban on on-farm burial was going to be managed. They certainly
left it to the eleventh hour to come to an agreement with the NFU, but the
result could have been worse. The charges, if they can be held at the proposed
level, seem reasonable and we have registered our intention to join the Ministry
scheme. I just hope that enough farmers remember to send their forms back by
84

Apr 30th

Will Carp Ponds Be Banned?

May 6th, and don’t stick them on their mantelpieces to gather dust. What I
don’t yet understand is whether, if over 51% of farmers agree, the scheme will
be compulsory for all, or whether some of us will continue to make our own
arrangements. That would surely have a dramatic effect on the final level of
charging for a national scheme.
Now that we are finally stuck with this apparent madness, I suppose we
have to try and make it work. The idea of a lorry coming round picking up
stillborn lambs is really taking precautions to the extreme, but if there remains
the faintest possibility that sheep scrapie had any bearing on the BSE crisis,
we must accept it. What a pity a non-burial regulation wasn’t in place across
Europe before the French started burying their BSE suspects as was widely
reported at the time. If a proper tally of their original cases had been available,
they might have found it difficult to be so disdainful of our beef.
And that raises another point about this idea that no farm animal remains
will ever be allowed to be recycled in a natural way throughout the EU. Some
ten years ago, Jenny and I went on a ten day natural history tour of eastern
Poland. It was a small group, mainly keen bird watchers, and led by a friend of
ours, Rod Lawrence, a well known Devon naturalist. We travelled by minibus
and visited some wonderful unspoilt countryside where humans have hardly
made an impact, and the original European wildlife still reigns supreme. These
areas are National Parks or World Heritage Sites and will obviously continue to
be protected after Poland becomes a full member of the EU next year.
What interests me, however, is how much the rest of Poland’s countryside
will change under EU farm regulations. The farming, as you would expect, was
very backward by our standards, and almost mediaeval in appearance. What
cows we saw were tethered by day along the roadsides, and returned, led on
long chains, to the villages to be milked and kept in overnight, and this was
in the middle of May. Milk was taken to the local dairies by bicycle, in small
churns dangling from the handle bars. The hay was being cut with scythes,
turned manually and pooked up in small haycocks to cure, and carried back to
the village farms by horse and cart. Some of the non-farming members of our
party thought this all looked wonderful and wished England was still the same.
(I have to confess the bird life beat ours out of sight).
Unless things have changed very substantially since we were there, I cannot
believe that Polish farmers will take kindly to being told that they cannot even
bury a dead lamb in future. In fact I would be very surprised if, at present,
they bother to bury a dead lamb at all, but look on it as the necessary food
supply for the abundant wildlife that surrounds them.
85

2003
In the course of our travels, we visited the large carp-ponds that are a
common feature of the country. We were told that, because Poland has very
little coastline, carp are an important source of the fish in their diet, very much
as in England in the days of the monasteries. These ponds are State-managed,
and rely on abattoir waste to feed the carp. While we were there, bird watching,
we saw the lorries arriving to tip their evil-smelling loads into what are in effect a
series of man-made lakes, which are drained in rotation to harvest the huge fish.
The contents of the lorries appeared to be untreated waste material straight out
of slaughter houses, cattle ear-tags and all.
A splendid example of good recycling, sustainable farming and economic
fish production - will such an obviously anti-Brussells activity be allowed to
continue? We shall see - Jenny and I have booked ourselves on a coach trip to
Poland this June.

May 7th
Gilbards Enjoy Reunion
We had a large family reunion here on Sunday. No, not my family - 33 members
of the Gillbard family, a well respected local farming family, who were visiting
the places where they had lived and farmed during the last 75 years. Alfred
Gillbard and his wife, seven sons and two daughters came to farm about five
miles from here in 1928. Alfred is long gone, but his son Les, now in his 80s,
grandson Brian, and great grandson Paul are still there and still going strong.
Hopefully for the future, Paul seems the most optimistic about the current state
of the industry.
As was usual in large farming families before the war, tenancies were sought
for the sons and daughters as they grew up and got married. Alfred did very
well for his lot; when I started here, there seemed to be Gillbards farming in
all the neighbouring parishes. One of his sons, Sidney, newly married, took the
tenancy here in 1933 - hence the reason for Sunday’s visit.
I am always very interested in finding out anything I can about the history
of this farm. When I first came, I was lucky enough to talk to four or five
people, then in their seventies or eighties, who remembered different occasions
on the farm as children in the 1890s. One, whose family farmed here then,
recalled as a six-year old seeing our roundhouse built, his elder brother having
to take a horse and cart to the nearest station to fetch the eight granite pillars
which came from Dartmoor. The pillars, seven foot high above ground and I
don’t know how deep below, must have taken some shifting. They have the
appearance of standing-stones that have been split lengthways, with the drill
86

May 7th

Gilbards Enjoy Reunion

holes still evident every few inches along their length. It is also still possible
to get a reaction from them with a water-divining rod, (it has been suggested
that they once stood on ley-lines). They were used to hold the heavy slate roof,
but leave the sides of the building open, so that the horse circling inside got
plenty of air as it turned the gears that drove the thrashing machinery. An
old lady, living locally, told me she clearly remembered, as a little girl, being
allowed to ride the horse the very first time the roundhouse was used. She even
remembered the name of the horse - Captain!
Then there was an odd glimpse from the past, when an old boy called,
asking for a glass of water. He explained that he was retracing the route from
Plymouth to Bristol he had walked as a ten-year old with his father, a cattle
drover, before the turn of the century. I could hardly believe that our back
lanes were on the old drove road, but who was I to argue with someone who
had actually done it. I have other direct reminiscences of those days, which I
suppose I ought to write down, if only for the sake of my grandchildren, but I
must get on about the Gillbards, who have got me in this frame of mind.
I met old Alfred only once. I had been here about a year when I went on
a coach trip for a day out to Polperro in Cornwall. Before we had been going
very long, I found I was sitting in front of someone who could tell me all about
the farm I had just taken on. It was farmer Gillbard, and by the time we got to
Cornwall, I had been told more about how to make a living here than if I had
learnt the hard way. It wasn’t all good news, either. Apparently his son, Sidney
had farmed here for three years, before moving on to a better place. The land
was all right, the big problem was rabbits. Being a long narrow piece of land,
with a lot of woodland on neighbouring farms, it was impossible to keep the
farm reasonably clear although the money from the local rabbit trapper would
easily pay the rent. I had already found that out. There were plenty of times
when one could count 70 or more rabbits in a seven acre field. They didn’t just
clear the headlands, they cleared the lot. Next there was the road in - it was
only a track with a stream running across it in one place. No place if you had a
car. Finally the house was no great shakes - the newlywed Gillbards only lived
here for one year. I don’t think old Alfred thought I would last very long.
What he didn’t know, of course, was that within a few years the rabbits
would all be gone, thanks to myxamatosis; the road would be proper tarmac,
thanks to the Milk Marketing Board introducing milk-tankers; and I would have
persuaded the bank to allow me to take out an overdraft to re-roof the house.
That last item did nearly finish me, overdrafts have a habit of uncontrollable
growth.
What Alfred didn’t tell me, but I found out on Sunday, was that times were
87

2003
so hard in the ’30s, that Sidney got this farm rent free for the first year, half
rent for the next, and full only after that. I am not surprised they left after
three years.

May 14th
Market Was Empty as a Desert
I went to Hatherleigh market last Thursday to see how much store cattle were
making. We have some steers to sell, and although we sell privately, if possible,
we need to know if we are asking a fair price.
We used to fatten all the beef cattle we produced from our suckler herd, but
since ‘foot and mouth’ and the decision to give up bull-beef production, we sell
all the male animals as steers, and now fatten only the heifers. We prefer to sell
to one particular friend who farms a few miles away. The only problem that
arises is ensuring that we don’t do each other down.
I am not a market man - never have been. By that I mean I don’t go
regularly like some farmers who would feel out of touch with friends and the
farming world, if they missed attending their local market every week. I can
well see the attraction of doing so, but starting life as a small struggling dairy
farmer, I never would have had the time even if I had had the inclination.
I was also put off selling through markets very early in my career when
attending Exeter market to sell some ‘bobby’ calves, which were difficult to
dispose of any other way. As I was leaving I met an acquaintance looking very
pleased with himself. He had apparently topped the market with some store
cattle and although trade was bad that day with too many cattle presented,
he was going home a happy man. It stuck in my rather simple young mind
at the time, that selling through livestock markets seemed to be some sort of
competition, with the devil take the hindmost. It appeared ridiculous that we
could not group together to regulate the supply to all our advantage. There
was an attempt in the 70’s to set up a livestock marketing board, but it never
got off the ground.
Livestock markets do, however, serve one obvious function - they determine
the going rate for animals at a particular time. You can, after all, take your
animals home again if the price is not right. How many farmers actually do so
on a regular basis I have never found out. I certainly never have - the added cost
would seem to be self defeating. Anyway, that was why I went to Hatherleigh
market last week, and, to my surprise, found the price of stores to be better
than for some years.
88

May 14th

Market Was Empty as a Desert

Why this should be I am at a loss to understand. The present high lamb
prices can be explained by the low value of the pound against the euro, which
boosts the export value and thus the entire lamb market. But that does not
follow for beef prices - our beef exports are negligible. Perhaps the buyers of
store cattle know something I don’t; I hope our friend is as confident when
agreeing a price since it is in our long term interest that he continues to buy
our steers in the future.
I drove home feeling somewhat despondent for all the obviously good cattle
trade. I hadn’t been to Hatherleigh store market since the ‘foot and mouth’
disaster and I was aware that, thanks to the rigorous hygiene precautions, cattle
and sheep were no longer sold on a Tuesday, when all the world and his wife
were present. The Tuesday market is still going strong, with the poultry auction,
plant and produce stalls, a canteen and everywhere a hive of activity. But no
animals for the kids to go and see being sold, no lowing of cattle or bleating
of sheep to greet you as you get out of your car. Bev and Jim went on the
Tuesday last week to buy some poultry, which is why I was delegated to go
on the Thursday. I could hear the cattle all right as I arrived, but the market
appeared deserted - not a soul in sight. My fellow farmers were there in the
cattle and sheep yards, I checked the prices and had a chat with one or two old
friends, but that was all. No canteen to have a cup of coffee and a laugh with
whoever had topped the market, nothing else to have a wander round and look
at, just back to the car and home.
I understand the auctioneers have coped with the enforced regulations very
well with sales of different farm stock on most days of the week, but for me
the soul has gone out of it. Are we going to be saddled with these Ministry
regulations for ever? Do the ‘powers that be’ really believe that the FMD
virus is still out there waiting to resurface? It would be nice to think that
while we are still putting up with all this disinfection-procedure nonsense, they
are ensuring maximum vigilance at ports and airports, closely checking any
doubtful premises like the Northumbrian pig farm which undoubtedly caused
the last outbreak, and working hard to get a ‘vaccine-to-live’ available in case
the worst occurs. I have my doubts.
In ten years they will have forgotten all about it, as they did before, and if
an outbreak occurs in 20 years time, no doubt by then we will have a different
bunch of officials who will delay again, in immediately stopping all livestock
movement and bringing in the army. I am afraid they never learn.

But How Will Highgrove Fare?
Thanks to Sue Connell of the Lustleigh Horticultural Society, Jenny and I had
a very enjoyable farm walk at Prince Charles’s Highgrove farm in Gloucester
last week. Jenny would have liked to see the garden, but all the available places
were taken for what is obviously, from the row of coaches lined up at the visitor
centre, a very popular attraction.
I am no gardener; the farm was all I was interested in and for two reasons.
Prince Charles is a very outspoken advocate for our beleaguered industry and
also a committed believer in organic farming. Did this stem from real experience
or was his farm just a rich man’s hobby?
I had read articles about Highgrove and seen the ‘David Attenborough’ TV
documentary showing a year in the running of the estate, but these had only
left me with a rather romantic impression of the place. Mud on your shoes is
the only real way to find out. In the event, I was very pleasantly surprised. If
the Prince is playing at being a farmer, his farm manager most certainly is not.
David Wilson, whose training and experience before coming to Highgrove was
entirely conventional, seems totally committed to farming organically and has
no illusions about the need to make the farm pay its way. I am not persuaded
that ‘muck and mystery’ as it used to be called is the future for food production,
but he was the most persuasive advocate I have met so far, and I have met a
few over the years.
The farm, to work organically, depends on rotational cropping, with clover
and beans providing the nitrogen, and large quantities of farm yard manure,
composted, to act as a soil conditioner. This is exactly as I remember farming
being taught when I was a student, although I don’t think any great importance
was attached in those days to composting muck. Certainly the use of bag
nitrogen was frowned on as the quickest way to impoverish your soil, but very
few worried about what it might do to human health. Growing enough food
for all was more important. Of course there is far more to farming organically
than that, as the bookkeeping required to be licensed by the Soil Association
testifies.
Obviously, to recycle the clover and beans and provide the farm yard manure
on the scale needed to maintain the fertility of a large arable farm organically,
sheep and cattle have to be part of the system. At Highgrove, there are two
herds of cattle - a suckler herd of 90 pedigree Aberdeen Angus and a dairy herd
of 160, and rising, pedigree Ayrshires. (The sight of a kilted prince striding
around is not likely to frighten those breeds.) There is also a flock of 500 ewes

which had recently finished lambing. It was interesting that the arable crops
are wheat, oats and rye, but not barley. Unless I got that wrong, that is most
unusual today, when barley and wheat are the two common crops of arable
farming. Nor is any cereal other than oats fed to the livestock. Again when
I started farming, barley was considered a toxic feed for ruminants, although
today it is used extensively in cattle rations.
The farm cannot be an easy one to manage, the two main blocks of land
being separated by the town of Tetbury. There must be times when Prince
Charles and the staff especially must wish the whole area was in a ring fence how they managed through FMD I hate to think. Considering that Highgrove is
very much in the public eye, it was encouraging to see that spit and polish was
not high on the agenda. It all looked very much like any other well run farm.
True, there weren’t old sheets of galvanised iron or broken gates lying about,
but there were plenty of weeds growing round the parked farm machinery, and
even the odd roof that showed signs of contact with a tractor loader. The farm
is not over staffed and I wondered at the overtime hours they must work or
whether the garden staff acted as back-up at busy times. The amount of tree
planting in the parkland and the miles of new hedges that Prince Charles is
putting in to divide the larger arable fields must be more than normal farm
work would allow.
I also wondered, as we travelled back to Devon after a very satisfying day out,
how the farm at Highgrove will fare if production subsidies are phased out. It is
very easy, as a farmer to calculate roughly how much subsidy your neighbours
are generating in their accounts, and this was no exception. Even with the extra
earnings from selling ‘organic’, I doubt whether beef or milk is over profitable
at present, and lamb is currently showing very little advantage over ‘inorganic’.
Growing market garden crops, which are not subsidised, organically is one thing,
but large scale arable farming without the necessary livestock is quite another.
Looking out of the coach window at the Cotswold countryside, it was very
obvious how much Highrove differed from its neighbours - vast acres of arable
farming but very few livestock to be seen.

Importance of Wearing Right Hat
As I walked out the other evening to where our nearest-to-calving suckler cows
are grazing, I noticed one, which had calved that day, looking keenly through
a little-used gate at the bottom of the field. I walked down to see what was
bothering it. Two very small fox cubs, venturing out for possibly their first look
at the outside world, were trying to pluck up the courage to follow the vixen
which I could see scavenging round the hedgerows. The cow and I stood there
watching for quite some time, until the cubs gave up and came back past us
and down the earth beside the gate where they were born.
It always amuses me to see the reaction of the cows to the wildlife that
surrounds them. Going out early in the morning and last thing in the evening
to check that there is no calving problem, I have often seen the vixen in among
the cows as they lie cudding, looking for worms and slugs or perhaps any leftover
scrap of afterbirth from a calving. Unless they have just calved, the cows take
no notice of her at all, and I can get pretty close using the cows for camouflage.
I hadn’t realised she had cubs so near. Cows seem very observant to anything
strange; I have seen them quite unmoved by badgers wandering among them
at night, but all rush to inspect a badger hunting at midday. Roe deer hardly
merit a glance, and rabbits are totally ignored.
Even I can go into the field without anything more than a quick sign of
recognition provided I am wearing my usual very old baseball-style cap. It gets
flung in the washing machine at regular intervals, and back on my head before
properly dry, but I put on another hat the other day as it was raining. I walked
into the field and every cow looked up, got up and watched me approaching
from 100 yards away. They shifted uneasily until I was nearly up to them,
before returning to their usual indifference. It’s obviously my headgear and not
me they register from a distance!
We are seeing the last of our Aberdeen Angus calves being born. We sold
on our Angus bull last autumn, but he obviously didn’t shirk his duty in the
last few weeks of his time here. We have had a dozen calves born in the last
ten days. We bought him five years ago from Richard and Caroline Haddock
as an unborn calf in a pure-bred Angus cow, in the hope of getting a bull to
breed from. We were lucky; he turned out very well and has produced well over
100 calves with hardly any that I can remember needing help at birth. That
is a very important point with a suckler herd which we aim to have calving
outdoors. A few of his offspring are coming into the herd as replacement cows,
so his time was up if we are to avoid inbreeding.
92

Jun 4th

Multiples Are Good Guys

We do very occasionally have trouble with our Simmental-cross calves at
birth, but our cows are generally quiet enough to help in the open field. The
few losses have sometimes been one calf of twins, which are small and don’t
make it. Last year, two of a set of triplets were born dead, without my realising
until the next day that the cow had more than the one she was happily looking
after. By the time I chanced across them, not much remained to be buried on
the spot. I suspect it was a lucky break for the same vixen that is in close
attendance this year.
What am I supposed to do, if it happens again now? Gather up the bits and
ring for a knacker or look the other way and leave it to nature? I know what
nine farmers out of ten will do, and I’ve no doubt we will do the same. That
doesn’t alter the fact that there is now a law against burial which, however
much we may feel is going too far, will have to be complied with. And the
only way that will work properly is to have a system that allows each area
to be the responsibility of one knacker business. In my opinion, that requires
proper management by DEFRA or some other government agency. So why did
they send out a misleading letter to all addresses with a farm holding number
asking, not whether we would accept a national scheme, but whether we might
be interested in considering one? Over 50% interest was required, before they
would take it any further. Time has now run out.
How many farms have more than one holding number? How many have no
livestock? How many of the letters are still in their envelopes with the rest of
the opened but only glanced at Ministry bumf? How I wish DEFRA had used
their wits and sent out a letter asking us to reply if we were not interested in a
national scheme. I guess they would have been lucky in reaching a 5% hit rate
to that question, and we would now be moving on to the next phase in getting
the whole thing organised.

June 4th
Multiples Are Good Guys
Doing our weekly supermarket shop - I am the trolley pusher - I noticed a lot of
New Zealand lamb in the meat section. There was some UK lamb on offer, but
not much. Seeing how well our lamb is selling at present, I checked the prices
and was not surprised the store was offering shoppers the choice. New Zealand
lamb-chops were about £6/kilo against ours at £10/kilo. OK, ours must be
fresher than something that has travelled halfway round the world, and I don’t
know how much New Zealand farmers are being paid, but I’ll bet the family
sitting down to dinner doesn’t ask ‘Mum’ where the lamb came from or even
93

2003
notice any great difference in taste. A French family might, but not an English
one.
Farmers never seem to have a good word to say about dealing with the
supermarkets, but for once, I’ll be the exception. If I say it myself, I have
had some little experience dealing with supermarkets. I was for many years
closely involved with the dairy farmer co-operative which is responsible for
promoting and marketing the milk produced by Jersey and Guernsey cows.
Being a loudmouth, I ended up where loudmouths often do, as Chairman of the
Co-operative. In fact I did ten years as Chairman, and a very interesting time
it proved to be.
Quality Milk Producers was founded in 1954 by a small group of farmers
who felt that those of us milking the Channel Islands breeds of cow were poorly
represented to the Milk Marketing Board. The membership grew very rapidly
to about 90% of the C.I. farmers in England and Wales who had contracts with
local dairy companies delivering the nations daily pinta. QMP’s job at that
time was to ensure that we got a fair price from the MMB and that Gold Top,
as we called our milk, was properly promoted to the housewife. We were in fact
very successful and Gold Top became a household name.
However as time went on, with the health lobby campaigning against fat
in the national diet and price inflation hitting doorstep delivery both working
against us, we faced a steady decline. By the 1970s, which was when I became
a QMP director, we desperately needed to sell our milk through shops, if we
were to maintain our place as a premium milk.
By then, the supermarkets were getting heavily into liquid milk sales, and
it seemed the obvious way for us to go. However it was not that simple; to the
milk buyer at that time, milk came under three headings - whole, semi-skim and
skim. There were none of the speciality milks there are now. We were breaking
new ground.
To begin with, we were amazed at how young the head milk buyers of the
various supermarkets were, and we approached them all at one time or another.
What on earth could they know about the complexities of the milk industry?
All they seemed interested in was how much profit per square foot of shelf space
the product would make.
Next, they wanted our milk either in their own brand name, or as an exclusive for a number of years. We realised that the supermarkets chains, being so
few and powerful, are paranoid about the competition. They may operate cosy
cartels at high level on the golf course, I wouldn’t know, but on the ground they
are for ever looking over their shoulders at what the opposition are doing and
charging. That eventually worked to our advantage, provided we used our own
94

Jun 11th

Where the Euro-Bison Still Roam

brand names, since once we were accepted by one chain, we had easier entry to
all the others. Getting into the first one was the difficulty.
There were problems of naming, packaging and trade marking to overcome.
Patenting ‘Gold Top’ was relatively easy by then - it was virtually protected
by the common law of ‘passing off’. Unfortunately the supermarkets wanted a
new product and the name ‘Breakfast Milk’, which we adopted for selling our
homogenised freezeable milk in cartons, proved very much harder. I spent three
years discovering all about the complexities of trademark law, even taking a
large Dairy Company to court for attempting to poach our brand.
Thankfully our efforts were rewarded. After one or two false starts, it was
Tesco that gave us the major breakthrough. They agreed to run a trial in the
London area, followed by distribution through the southern counties after six
months if successful, with national sales a year later. We gave them a two
year exclusive. They went national within a year and I had the satisfaction of
proving it by asking a string-vest clad Scots building worker buying a pint of
Breakfast Milk in a Perth Tesco in his lunch break why he chose it. He said it
was the best milk in the store.
That was many years ago. Q.M.P. now has a number of milk and milk
products in most of the major supermarkets. With their system of delivery into
a single depot for distribution, they can be available on a daily basis anywhere
in the country. For small specialist fresh products there is no other way of
achieving national sales. Supermarkets are not all bad.

June 11th
Where the Euro-Bison Still Roam
When you read this, Jenny and I will, hopefully, be on a fortnights holiday
in Poland. Like everybody who asks us where we are going, you are probably
wondering ‘why Poland?’ Weather permitting, Jim will be making silage, so
the timing is not ideal. We still manage without using contractors, and as I am
sometimes called on as a standby tractor driver, I feel guilty at being away, but
at my age my tractor-driving is probably more of a liability. The tour company
we are going with cancelled our chosen date in May for lack of interest, but
offered us a discount as compensation if we went now.
We have two reasons for going to Poland. The first is certainly not to
witness their referendum on entry to the EU which will take place while we are
in Warsaw. I would expect it to be a foregone conclusion, considering Poland’s
troubled history. What we are very interested to see is how much farming
has changed since we were there eight years ago. As I have mentioned before,
95

2003
what we saw of Polish agriculture was at that time almost medieval. We were
travelling through eastern Poland on a nature study tour, visiting wonderful
areas for wildlife, but not necessarily the best farmland.
Our trip included an area in the Carpathian mountains in the south east,
which looked like a vast tract of rolling grassland, but with no livestock or human
presence. Our guides, university graduates doing a holiday job to practice their
English, said it had been farmed in the past, but that the villages had been
invaded from the Ukraine or Germany so many times over the generations and
razed to the ground with wholesale slaughter of the inhabitants, that no one
would live there anymore. It is now Government owned land and, as a farmer,
I was asked to put forward a possible use for it before scrub woodland took
over, with the loss of the birds and butterflies that seemed to be enjoying that
special habitat. I jokingly suggested setting up a herd of wild European bison,
as a tourist attraction as well as providing meat. They were already building
up bison numbers in the Bialowieza Forest, which we were to see later on the
trip. If someone has since taken up the idea seriously, we may have more to
worry about from competition with our west country grass-fed beef!
The Bialowieza Forest, the last great primeval lowland forest in Europe, with
plant and animal life as it was before man appeared, will be a honey trap for
anyone visiting Poland in the future. I just hope the influx of tourists does not
spoil the very thing they have come to experience. Cathedral Grove, the last
area of untouched Douglas forest on Vancouver Island, Canada, had changed
almost out of all recognition when we were there last autumn, compared with
15 years before. Then we wandered at will with no one else to be seen. Now
there is a visitors centre, car park, and fenced paths thronging with people.
Very sad, but almost inevitable.
The third place we went to was in the north, a vast wilderness of wetlands,
with a great variety of bird life and the occasional elk. Between these areas,
we did visit farms where storks, corncrakes and other rare farmland birds were
abundant, and I took the opportunity to ask questions about the state of farming. The general feeling was pretty negative, with very few of the younger
generation wishing to continue life as peasants, working with horses and living
in some cases in what appeared to be log cabins. There were a few youngsters,
we were told, who were going to stay with it, but only by expansion and mechanization, if they could find the money. We never actually met any, and it will
be interesting to see from the coach windows, which may be the nearest we can
get to a farm, if there is any evidence of this happening. There was no sign then
of tram lining in the corn fields, which will be easy to spot this time, indicating
a change away from what was virtually organic farming.
96

Poland Fears Entry Into EU

The other reason we are going is to accompany Joe and June, our American
neighbours, who haven’t been before. Their surname is Modzelewski, which
gives you a clue. Actually, June is English, but went to the States in her youth
and married Joe, a second generation New Yorker. She was determined to live
at least part of her life in England, and with her family grown up, she came
over to find somewhere in Devon near relations, in the hope that Joe might
eventually retire here. We were very lucky that ten years ago she bought the
small farmhouse on land next to us, from Jim and Bev who had lived there when
they were newly married. Joe has taken early retirement and we now have very
good friends as our nearest neighbours. Joe has never been to Poland. Both
his parents, although born in America, went back to Poland as babies and only
met and married after returning to New York as adults. As a result, Joe’s first
language until he went to school was Polish. I am hoping it will all come back
to him and that this time we shall have our own interpreter.

June 18th
Poland Fears Entry Into EU
Kochane przyjaciele (dear friends), we are safely back from our fortnights holiday in Poland. You can see why we needed an interpreter. It is bad enough
trying to pronounce the language, let alone understand it. As I mentioned last
week, Joe and June, our American neighbour and his wife, who joined us on a
package coach tour, were seeing Poland for the first time. Joe’s grandparents
had emigrated to America, and Joe had spoken only Polish as a youngster. We
were interested to see how quickly he picked it up again. I think he’d conned
us - he was fluent as soon as we crossed the border, although he was quick to
point out that he would hesitate to get involved in a philosophical discussion.
Watching the faces of the various people we talked to when he switched into
Polish to help them with their English was good enough for me.
We stayed a night in Berlin both on the way and on the way back, which
gave us a chance to see that city and nearby Potsdam. We were very lucky to
have as our guide on both occasions a native Berliner who had lived through
the fall of the city to the Russians, worked for many years as an interpreter
for the army in the British sector, and had detailed knowledge of the Potsdam
Conference. The palace where it took place is preserved exactly as it was when
Europe was carved up by Truman, Stalin and Churchill, at the end of the war.
I didn’t realise that Churchill had to be told halfway through one of the sessions
that he had lost the General Election together with his seat in the Commons.
Ernie Bevin offered to be the one to tell him; he was called out of the conference
97

2003
room, (no one knows how Bevin broke the news) and he returned to England
without being seen again. Clem Attlee took over. It is strange to think that
Bevin went to our village school here at Morchard Bishop and started work
aged 11 on a farm a few miles away in Copplestone.
My real interest, however, was to see how much Poland had changed agriculturally since Jenny and I were there before. The short answer is ‘not at all’.
Travelling across northern Europe on our way to Warsaw, it was a very good
time of year to compare the farming in the different areas of what is really the
breadbasket of the EU. There was a retired Essex arable farmer with us on the
trip, who gave me his opinion of the crops as seen from our coach. Holland and
West Germany looked well farmed, with Belgium a poor third. I thought that
none of the crops looked as good as those we had seen in Kent on our way to
Dover. It was surprising how badly East Germany showed up against the west
as we neared the Polish border - the remaining influence of Communism and
state farming perhaps?
Once into Poland, the farming changed to the strip cultivation of small
farms, with potatoes, vegetables and soft fruit alternating with wheat, rye and
hay on tripods, endlessly repeated as we neared Warsaw. The few animals we
saw were cows, rarely more than two or three to a farm, tethered at the edges of
the plots and led home in the evenings to be milked and returned the following
morning. We travelled over a thousand miles through the country and I saw
perhaps half a dozen small groups of cattle grazing freely in all that distance.
We never passed a milk lorry or milk factory, so where their milk industry is I
have no idea. There must be one, since Polish UHT milk was available in shops,
although I didn’t see fresh milk on sale.
While we were in Warsaw, the referendum on Poland’s entry to the European
Union was taking place. Although no one we spoke to seemed very enthusiastic
about the idea, it seemed to be taken for granted that they would join. Our
Warsaw guide, a 34-year-old Polish lady, summed up their thinking very well,
saying that they had barely got to grips with governing themselves after years of
subjugation by Germany and Russia. They hardly trusted their own politicians,
let alone British or other European ones to tell them how to run their country.
What did surprise us was the very real concern we heard repeatedly from city
people about the damage that joining the EU would do to their farmers, who
were already under extreme financial pressure.
According to the guide books, Poland is the size of Britain and Ireland put
together. Over half its land area is a central-lowland fertile arable plain, with
forests and lakes to the north and uplands and mountains in the south making
up the remainder. With a population of under 40 million people and, if my
98

Jul 2nd

Poland Faces up to EU Changes

calculations are correct, over 15 million hectares of farmland, one would assume
that Poland should do very well out of the Common Agricultural Policy. That
does not seem to be the feeling in Poland. It is seen as the end of their way of
farming. Over 85% of the farm land is privately owned. Even the communists
could only convert 2% to collective farming - they gave up trying in the end.
The real problem is that more than half the land is made up of a million small
farms, averaging 8 hectares or 20 acres. Farming is reckoned to employ about
2 million people or 10% of the working population. With 18% unemployment,
the last thing Poland wants is a rapid exodus from the countryside.
Before leaving England, Joe had been in touch with the Polish Embassy in
London, who arranged for us to meet a leading agricultural economist when we
were in Warsaw. It proved very informative meeting which I will tell you about
next week.

July 2nd
Poland Faces up to EU Changes
As I mentioned last week, Joe had arranged for us to have a meeting with an
agricultural economist while we were in Warsaw. Fortunately he was a young
man who spoke excellent English, which made it easier to ask him questions
direct without having to use Joe as an interpreter. He began by giving us a
complete rundown on the precise details of the level of support payments which
Polish farmers could expect to receive from next year. He seemed to take it for
granted that their referendum, which was due to be held the following weekend,
would result in Poland’s joining the EU.
I will do my best not to bore you with figures, but as a farmer I am keen to
understand the impact that the newly joining eastern European countries will
have on our own farming, that is if the Common Agricultural Policy doesn’t
collapse under the strain. Poland, by far the largest of the new EU members, will
add over 15 million hectares of land qualifying for arable aid, well over three
times our UK total. Are we likely to be swamped under a tide of increased
production which will make corn farming in Britain a thing of the past? At
present Poland, with a population of under 40 million people, is virtually selfsufficient in food. More than half their farmland looks as it must have done
100 years ago, with small tractors only just beginning to replace horses as the
motive power, and little evidence of chemical fertilizers or sprays to push up
yields.
From next year, the influence of Brussells will swing into action. Initially,
farmers will receive only 25% of the direct payments currently available to ex99

2003
isting EU farmers, with a further 11% for rural development. This will increase
each year until 2013, before Polish farmers are on level terms with the rest of us.
To soften this blow, state aid can increase this by about half as much again, but
in view of the present state of the Polish economy, this may not be forthcoming.
I reckon it would amount to about 400 million pounds, and it’s hard enough
getting that kind of money out of our own Exchequer.
One significant difference to our support payments will be the complete
absence of any direct livestock subsidies - no headage payments at all. Instead
all land used for fodder crops, including grazing, will be included in the arable
payments, with a reference limit on production, which would scale down the
entitlement per hectare if this was exceeded. I hope I understood this correctly,
since it will considerably simplify the paperwork that Polish farmers will be
saddled with. No worry about stocking rates, no counting of animals at frequent
intervals, and only basic inspection needed at all. How far mapping of all land
will be required I don’t know, but I presume there will have to be a check to
exclude what is used for potatoes, veg and soft fruit on the million or so small
farms which rely on these crops for a very large part of their income. I asked
if these farms did any form filling now and whether they would welcome this
aspect of Brussells largess. The short answer was ‘if they don’t do it, they won’t
get it’, but I don’t think our economist was being uncharitable; his parents were
farmers and he fully understood the problems of those who in Britain would be
called smallholders.
Apparently all land owners pay a land tax, varying according to land quality,
so some form of registration system must already be in place. Top rate of VAT
is 22%, with graduations down to 3% on food, with the very smallest farmers
exempted - so again an element of bookkeeping is there. However, with all
the European regulations on farming practice to comply with (milk hygiene
immediately springs to mind), there are going to be a lot of very unhappy
farmers out there come next year. Will it be worth their while one wonders.
With an average size of 8 hectares for the majority, the subsidy will be worth
about £400 per farm. That sound insignificant, but you have to bear in mind
that the national average income is currently only £300 a month. Small farmers
are at the very bottom of the heap, and are only surviving by their ability to
live off their land. Food is relatively expensive, taking over 25% of disposable
income, so it is easy to see why, with 18% unemployment, farmers are hanging
on to what they have. Nor are the authorities very anxious to see farms increase
in size too quickly. They estimate that over the next 15 years farm size will only
go up to an average of 30 hectares (75 acres) and even that will put one and a
100

half million people out of work. And there are no other jobs or diversification
opportunities in rural areas.
Hardly a massive threat to us in the short term. There is a fair amount of
land already farmed on a comparable basis to western Europe. As we returned
through the most industrialised area in south west Poland, we saw large farms
where the crops looked almost as good as our own, obviously using the full range
of fertilizers and sprays, and these farms are unlikely to increase production very
much.
The remainder of Poland’s farmland, owned by those one million small farmers, is under-exploited and virtually organic but very rich in wildlife. It does
seem incongruous that while the rest of Europe is trying to evolve a system of
farm support that will enhance the environment, Poland is likely to be driven
in the opposite direction.

July 9th
Butterfly Thistles Quandary
It is over three weeks since we got back from our holiday in Poland and already
it seems a long time ago. I am glad we went and I can strongly recommend it
to anyone interested in seeing farming from a different perspective before it is
too late.
As on our trip to America last autumn, a heat wave followed us to every
city we visited, but the air-conditioning was nowhere comparable. The only cool
place was down a salt mine near Cracow. This was probably the highlight of the
various excursions that these organised coach trips always include. The mine
was no longer in operation, but in years past the workings had been decorated
with wall carvings and statues in rocksalt by the miners. One enormous cavern,
the ‘miners cathedral’, was complete with altar, crucifix, biblical scenes on the
walls, chandeliers and even ornamental floor tiles all carved out of salt. An
extraordinary sight 400 feet below ground. The lifts were also the original
miners lifts, an experience in itself. Our ‘health and safety’ Executive would
have a field day.
One lasting memory of Poland will be the rows of hay-pooks on every small
farm we passed - thinking of the manual work that had gone into setting them up
and knowing that, whatever the weather, they would probably produce better
quality hay than anything we were likely to make here. Another will be the
sight of a large palm tree in the middle of Warsaw. It was a gift from President
de Gaulle to the people of Poland and stands at a busy intersection of the two
main thoroughfares in the city centre. It is made of coloured plastic and looks
101

2003
totally lifelike but completely out of place. It wasn’t explained what it signified.
Did de Gaulle have a spare one he wanted to get rid of or was he warning the
Poles that they should never dream that their agriculture might one day be
more important in Europe than that of the French?
Back home, silage making was not quite finished. Some rain early in June
after we left had delayed Jim from starting, so I did after all get called on to
do a few days tractor driving. The sheep are now all shorn and 30 acres of
hay-making awaits a spell of hot weather. I am not offering to make pooks.
The corn is changing colour and harvest will soon be on us.
At this time of the year, I normally carry a thistle cutter around with me
when I check the cattle. The particular thistles I am after are the large spear
thistles, those enormous bush-like thistles which can become a plague if not kept
in check every year. In the last ten years we have reduced them to manageable
proportions, so that a week at the right time, just before they flower, is all it
takes on our 150 acres of permanent pasture. Of course there are some I miss,
or seed that blows in from a neighbour, so that, like painting the Forth Bridge,
it is not a job you ever really get rid if.
By now, this year, I should have finished - but there’s a problem. It has been
a pretty good early summer for butterflies here, especially that very beautiful
immigrant, the Painted Lady. Unfortunately it has the habit of laying it’s eggs
singly, one on a plant, and the plant it favours is the spear thistle. I am finding
that, in some fields, every spear thistle has got a three-parts grown caterpillar
in residence. There are always a few to be found, and I normally cut off the
many flower-heads and leave those plants for the pasture-topper to deal with
later, after we’ve finished the corn harvest and the butterflies have hatched
and are on the wing. I started doing that this year, but after leaving about
thirty plants, I got fed up cutting off the flower-heads and abandoned the job
for the time being. So I have a quandary. Do I ignore the caterpillars, pretend
to myself that they’re not there and finish the job quickly before the flowers,
which are beginning to show red, are fully out? Or do I forget to take my thistle
cutter with me as I walk round the cattle, and look forward to an explosion of
Painted Ladies later in the summer? I look back to 1955 and the sight of
countless Clouded Yellows, that other irregular immigrant, which danced that
year across our red clover fields, and I know the answer. But I shall probably
be full time thistle-cutting as a result for years to come - you know the old
saying “one years seeding, seven years weeding”. And it won’t increase future
generations of Painted Ladies one iota, since they don’t survive our winter and
don’t fly back where they came from. That is, of course, unless global warming
takes a hand and the Painted Lady, together with the Clouded Yellow, becomes,

like the Red Admiral, a semi-resident species. And that just might make cutting
thistles worth while.

July 16th
Memories of Former Droughts
The streams that form the boundaries of our farm are fast drying up. We have
mains water troughs in most fields, but two areas of permanent pasture still
depend on streams for cattle to drink. In 1976 they dried up completely, the
only time I have known it to happen, and one or two large trees growing on
their banks, which had been here five times longer than I have, died as a result.
Trees on our highest ground, which overlies rock, had obviously put down deeper
root systems and came through that dreadful summer unscathed. This is not a
summer anything like that, but grazing is certainly going to get short if the heat
wave goes on. And in our case, quite large areas of the best summer grazing
will temporarily be closed to our cattle. It will no doubt be pouring with rain
by the time you read this, but it does remind me of the difference mains-water
makes to this farm and the stock carrying capacity of many others round here.
I mention this because, last Saturday, we went to the South West Forest
Woodfair at Roadford Lake. I always enjoy Roadford as a beautiful stretch
of water in the Devon countryside, but I am also pleased to see how far the
water level has dropped during a dry spell. That may seem an odd remark to
make, but it reminds me of the uproar there was at the time about drowning
such a large area of farm land, instead of putting the much needed reservoir
on Dartmoor. Subsequent events seem to have proved the correctness of the
location; Dartmoor has enough visitors already and, although farmers were
among the chief opponents then, the value of our land for food production
seems now to be slipping. A shortage of water would be as serious for farmers
as for everyone else.
Roadford Lake, however, is coming to be far more than an insurance against
dry weather. Among other amenities, it provides an ideal site for the annual
Woodfair organised by the South West Forest. For readers who may be unaware
of the existence of a forest in our part of the world, may I explain that this is
not a huge tract of woodland that you had somehow overlooked. Rather it is
the name given to a project, perhaps I should say ‘vision’, to revitalise that area
of the South West bounded by Dartmoor, Exmoor and Bodmin Moor. The area
was identified by Charles Vancouver in 1808 as being ‘where all green things
are crushed between the hammer of the west wind and the anvil of the yellow
clay’.
103

2003
The original scheme aimed to encourage tree planting as a way of increasing
the richness, in every sense of that word, of an area approaching nearly a million
acres. The target was to plant up an extra 40 thousand acres over a 15 year
period, which would increase the tree cover from 10% to 15%, still a long way
short of most European countries. The idea was not without its opponents when
it was launched in 1996; I suppose there were many residents who visualised
a kind of ‘New Forest in Hampshire’ tourist attraction being foisted on them,
when in reality the intention was simply to make woodland part of the lives and
livelihoods of all us, as it used to be in the past. In recent years it has tended
to be a preserve of the Forestry Authority and commercial timber growers.
The ‘South West Forest’ is not, therefore, a large chunk of woodland. It is the
name of the partnership of the many organisations who came together to make
something happen. There are too many to list here but if any one name must
be mentioned it is that of Rachel Thomas, who chaired the original steering
committee and turned, in six short years, a rather hopeful dream into solid
reality. Considering the diverse interests of those involved and the problems of
funding, it has been an incredible achievement. Ian Mercer, who has taken over
from Rachel as chairman, has a very tough act to follow.
The Woodfair at Roadford is, together with the Cookworthy Centre and the
many areas of woodland now in existence with ‘South West Forest’ support, one
of the tangible results. This is the third year it has been held and it has already
doubled in size. Everything remotely connected with woodland and timber is
on show. If you live in this part of the region and missed it, make sure you
come next year.
If I were to suggest an addition for the future, it would be the presence of a
Jazz Band playing by the lake, to sit and listen to, after going round the stalls
and demonstrations. Jenny and I had our music that evening, as it happened.
It was the annual jazz-evening in a woodland glade by the river at Worlington,
my most picturesque village in Devon, a few miles north of us. It is organised
in aid of charity, and always draws a big crowd - over 250 people this time.
Taking a picnic meal, listening or dancing to the music, and feeling the night
draw in after one of the hottest days of the summer - trees have many uses.

Phone Truths for DEFRA Data

July 23rd
Phone Truths for DEFRA Data
About three weeks ago, I had a phone call asking if I could spare ten minutes
to take part in a survey on the recent performance of DEFRA, or to be more
specific, the Rural Payments Agency. Telephone surveys seem to be all the
rage these days, and although it is tempting to just put the phone down, I
generally ask politely what they are in aid of. They normally turn out to
be an underhand way of trying to sell something, but the caller’s accent can
sometimes be so unintelligible that I end up putting the phone down anyway.
On this occasion the voice was crystal clear, and the thought of giving my
opinion of the RPA, especially after the cock-up over our suckler cow premiums
last year, was irresistible.
Would I answer some questions, giving a points score from one to ten - the
usual method nowadays? Before the questions could start, I asked the caller if
she was employed by DEFRA. No, I was assured, this was an independent survey
commissioned by Government and my anonymity was guaranteed. I asked how
we had been chosen to take part, and it seemed that the ‘farm holding number’
method of selection had been used. That didn’t bode too well for an accurate
result, considering the fiasco over the survey for a ‘carcass disposal scheme’.
The questions were what you would expect - how efficient did I rate the
RPA, were the staff polite when dealing with problems, how knowledgeable
were they, etc. It was tempting to give a score of one to each, but I resisted being frivolous wouldn’t improve things, I am sure there are many members of
staff in our Exeter RPA office doing their best, and, who knows, we were still
waiting for this year’s Suckler Cow Premium which was due by the end of June.
To finish with, I was asked if I would like to make any comments, which I
did with gusto. The questioner was obviously a very good shorthand typist she read them back to me verbatim, and said they would be included with my
answers. What I would like to know is who ordered this survey and for what
purpose? And who, if anyone, will read my comments?
The end of June has come and long gone and we still have not had our
Suckler Premium. Nor have we received any explanation from the RPA as to
why it is late. Have we a problem we don’t know about or have they? Ten
days ago, I had another phone call, again asking if I could spare ten minutes to
take part in a survey into the performance of the RPA. I explained that I had
already done one, but in the circumstances would gladly do another. The girl
apologized, and said there must be some mistake. It seems even the organization
doing the survey can’t get it right.
105

2003
What a strange way to run DEFRA, which was supposed to be an improvement on the old Min of Ag. It is surely the responsibility of DEFRA Ministers
to see to it that their various departments are operating efficiently, not to judge
by the opinions of those of us who, in many cases, are disgruntled farmers.
Which brings me to the new Animal Health Minister at DEFRA, our own
Ben Bradshaw. I see he is reported recently as saying that the FMD outbreak
was due to ‘bad practice at a pig farm’ rather than poor policing of illegal meat
imports. He pointed out to outraged farmers that seizures of illegal meat had
trebled in the last three years. I hesitate to unfairly criticize Mr Bradshaw
so early in his new job; I remember meeting him to seek help on a farming
matter when he was first elected MP for Exeter, and he replied that he was
hardly the right person to take it up, since he had no constituents who were
farmers. Perhaps he will turn out to be the best farm Minister since Labour
came to power - that shouldn’t be too difficult. But suggesting that three times
‘extremely little’ is a significant improvement on meat seizures of three years
ago, is not a very clever answer to farmers worried at the almost non-existent
controls at our borders. I wonder if Mr Bradshaw is aware that the pig farm in
Northumberland which he cited as leading to FMD, had had its ‘swill feeding’
licence renewed by MAFF a fortnight before the outbreak occurred. Judging
by the television pictures at the time, there is no disputing the pig farm should
have been closed down - what on earth was MAFF thinking about? And does
Mr Bradshaw know that the swill containers on that pig farm have, even now,
not been properly emptied and disinfected or otherwise disposed of. OK, I
know the virus does not survive forever, but that hardly ties in with all the
disinfection procedures we all undertook at the time, and to some extent are
still saddled with.
Mr Bradshaw’s future as a farm Minister is probably of no consequence
anyway. I read that Lord Haskins, the Prime Minister’s rural guru, is intending
to make a report this autumn, proposing that DEFRA be done away with as
being quite unnecessary to food production and farming in a modern world.
Why he discloses this openly in advance, before reporting to the PM, is, I
presume, to avoid any ‘leakage’. Pull out the bath plug oneself, and ensure no
possible embarrassment.

Show Just Like Good Old Days

July 30th
Show Just Like Good Old Days
Mud, mud, glorious mud! Not exactly the description the organizers of the
Mid Devon Show were using last Saturday. We set off for Tiverton in a steady
drizzle. The weather forecast was optimistic for the afternoon, so I didn’t bother
to take wellies - one doesn’t take them to agricultural shows anymore. I am not
a great show-goer, but the Mid Devon at Tiverton, only revived in recent years,
is our own local show and very successful it always is. By the time we arrived,
there was the usual queue of cars and we were directed into the overflow car
park, which augured well for attendance figures. It was not too bad underfoot
and if it had stopped raining at midday, all would have been well.
Everyone was smiling. Who cares about a little warm rain? I even joked
with passing acquaintances that it was like old times picking a way through the
muddy grass compared to the tarmac of the modern County shows. But as time
went on the rain kept coming down and the tents filled up with people taking
shelter. I wandered through the cattle lines, which seemed fuller than usual.
The bull judging was taking place - deep concentration on the faces of judge and
handlers, complete oblivion to the water running down their necks. It might
have been a balmy summer’s day for all the notice they took of the weather, as
they nudged the legs of their animals into their best stance. The bulls looked
happy not to be in blazing sunshine, their coats unusually wet and sleeked down,
but in the splendid condition they always are at these events. I confess, as I
stood in the mud looking at them from behind, the word ‘hippopotamus’ did
slip through my mind.
I wandered on dodging from tent to tent to escape the rain. I don’t normally
go into every tent at shows, but walking slowly round each one to dry out a
little, it was an eye-opener to see how many varieties of exotic fowl existed, or
different breeds of rabbit, or types of pigeon. I spent longer than I usually do in
the craft tent and the Lloyd Maunder Food Hall proved a big attraction. By the
time I had stood in a long queue for a venison burger, sampled the scrumpy, and
talked to friends, I was nearly dry again. Apparently my family were wondering
where I had got to, so it was out again into what had now become something
like a paddy field to see if they were thinking of calling it a day. By the time I
had stopped at all the hospitality tents, which they had left just minutes before,
another hour had gone by.
We left for home at half past three, much earlier than usual. My shoes and
socks were full of mud as we came out of the entrance gate, but a river running
down the road proved very handy to paddle through, before getting into the
107

2003
car. In case you are wondering, I actually enjoyed my day. It was how shows
used to be on wet days. Those are the ones that stick in the memory. Who will
forget the Devon County when it was held in Exeter about 30 years ago and the
car parks got totally bogged down? It took four stalwart attendants to push us
out, leaving a huge dent in the back of our old Austin Cambridge, which was
there for the rest of its days.
Don’t get me wrong. I am desperately sorry for the organisers, but I am
sure from the crowds that attendance figures were pretty good, and a fine day
next year will bring us back in greater numbers. It was a shame for the main
ring events, which eventually had to be abandoned. It was worst of all for the
smaller stand-holders, who will have a lot of cleaning up to do, before going on
to their next event. But everywhere I went, people looked cheerful. There were
comments about farming being used to accepting whatever the weather could
throw at us. In fact, if it had been fine and hot, many of us would have been
at home, getting on with the harvest.
Which brings me to the point about the future. I am probably going to
offend many when I suggest that agricultural shows are becoming a trifle boring
and predictable. All the big ones are laid out on a permanent basis, with hard
roads and solid buildings. One year’s show seems just like the previous year’s,
with little variation. I can remember when the County Show used to be at a
different location each year. Even the Royal went round the country; I believe
it was held at Plymouth in the late 1940’s. The shows in those days seemed to
be more of an event not to be missed. You went to consider which breeds of
livestock were most suited to the times, or which machinery firm would give you
the best discounts. I know these days we are trying to attract more townies to
come and see what farming is all about, but do permanent sites actually achieve
this. And I wonder if commercial farmers will be all that bothered about being
there in the future.

August 6th
No More PAYE Documents
Last Friday was one of those days after which things are never quite the same
again. That sounds a bit dramatic – ‘things’ in this case is only the ‘day to day
farm work’, and the reason things will never be quite the same is that David
Rice, who has worked with us here on the farm more or less continuously for
the last 40 years, retired on Friday. Dave, who was born and brought up in
Morchard Bishop, first came here in the winter of ’63, to help his brother Les,
our local builder. Dave had come home from Shropshire, where he was working
108

Aug 6th

No More PAYE Documents

in forestry, to spend Christmas with his family. That was the winter of the great
snow, and as forestry work was temporarily at a stand still, Dave was filling in
time until he went back up north. When the building job in our farmhouse was
finished, Dave offered to stay on and help with the farm work. And the rest as
they say is history. I sometimes wonder if Jenny and I would have survived the
difficult times if Dave had not come to work for us and I won’t embarrass him
by saying more than that.
Not that I am expecting Dave to disappear suddenly from the farm - he
is not the sort to sit under a tree in his garden contemplating the weather.
Hopefully he will be around much as before, but in future he will be working
when he likes and doing what he wants to do and often for people other than
us. He could have gone on working for us on a part time basis – I don’t think
Jim has any intention of taking on anyone to replace him, but I am very pleased
Dave has decided to become self-employed as he winds down in the years ahead.
In fact I shall be surprised if, in the future, more and more work on the smaller
farm businesses in the South West is not done on a contract basis. I know there
is a worry that we are losing the skilled work force in the countryside, but I
reckon there is huge potential for people to specialize not just as contractors
with extensive agricultural machinery, but as individuals doing particular jobs
they enjoy but on a number of different farms.
Something that will change for me in all this is the pleasure of suddenly
not having to act as an unpaid tax collector. I have never understood how
the nation allowed itself to be saddled with the ‘Pay As You Earn’ income tax
system introduced by a Labour Government in 1947. PAYE seems to have
become one of the immutable facts of life, which we don’t even question, but
why employers don’t get their very considerable time involved paid for, I have
never understood.
And another thing – why do people who are employed have to pay income tax
on their wages or salary immediately they earn it, while the self-employed get
away with paying their tax roughly 15 months later? It seems quite unfair that
the very rich can virtually run a business on the proceeds. I might worry that
the Chancellor will spot this, and dream up some ‘New Labour’ tax collection
system to catch everyone, but no doubt he is happy taxing the accountants who
the self-employed are obliged to use.
PAYE has become almost an industry in itself, with corresponding mountains of paperwork arriving every year to update us on the latest twists in the
regulations. Together with VAT instructions monthly, I seem to have files full
of what two years down the road can only be described as waste paper. One of
my original reasons for becoming a farmer was to ensure that I never had to do
109

2003
any paperwork – what a joke. In those days income tax on a farming business
was at a flat rate based on the number of acres farmed and the only other tax
was the ‘tithe’, which was being phased out.
PAYE seemed more laid back then. We used to get chased by the tax office
in Exeter if we were late with our monthly returns, as we are now, but in the old
days a tax collector would often come out to the farm if we were too behind and
help us with our form filling, collecting a cheque at the same time. I’m afraid
we farmers are not clever enough these days at appearing stupid. I remember
one occasion in the 1950’s, when we were employing the son of a neighbour
who, when he got married, had his tax code changed and I had to repay all his
tax already collected during that year. I was walking down our lane with an
axe on my shoulder after repairing a hole in a hedge, when a large taxi pulled
up behind me carrying a tax collector, who wound down the window to ask if
I was the farmer he was looking for. I said I was pleased to see him since he
owed me money for a change. Unfortunately the collectors hadn’t caught up
with the inspectors and he knew nothing about it – he was only empowered to
take money, not to hand any back. He refused to even get out of the taxi much
to the amusement of the driver, who offered to stay until he did. Perhaps it
was sight of the axe or even my red beard, which was not a common feature in
those days. My money wasn’t refunded until many months later.

August 13th
New Bull Must Work Fast
We seem to have had a very busy week, thanks to the fine weather. The rain
on St Swithin’s day, although very welcome at the time, arrived before we had
started making our late hay crop. It began to look as if we might have missed
the best haymaking time, but this heat wave has allowed Jim to catch up and,
although the grass had gone past it’s best, it is all baled up and stacked away.
And what a heat wave it has been. With all the problems of poor harvest
prospects in mainland Europe, perhaps our politicians will think again about
running down British agriculture.
Hopefully by the time you read this, our own corn harvest should just about
have been completed. The combine is due as I write, and with both the barley
and oats ripe enough in this heat, the thirty acres will be cut in one run and the
straw baled the next day. What a difference to 50 years ago. We grew about
thirty acres of corn then, but harvesting took at least three weeks with good
weather – cutting with a binder, stooking, stacking, and thatching the ricks.
And the corn still had to be threshed – a job for the following winter. Today
110

Aug 13th

New Bull Must Work Fast

it takes three days, with the corn in the bin and the straw in the barn, barring
accidents.Who wants to go back to the good old days?
Earlier last week, we went and fetched a new young bull that Jim had bought
to replace our Aberdeen Angus, which we sold last autumn. Our old Simmental
was supposed to cover any cows not in calf through the winter, but I think he
may be a bit past it as cows are returning that should be well in calf. The
new boy will have to get his act together a bit sharpish, or there will be some
late calving next spring. My old friend Albert Beer, farmer, journalist and long
time Secretary to the Devon Breed Society, will be delighted to hear that our
new boy is a ‘Ruby Red’, as Devons are affectionately known.
Why have we bought a Devon bull? There are a couple of reasons on this
occasion. We have had a Devon bull in the past to ring the changes in our
crossbred suckler herd, and a very nice bull he was, but the ‘over thirty month
scheme’ which has plagued most suckler-beef producers in recent years, meant
that his offspring had to be pushed to reach the weight required by the abattoirs
by that age. All the traditional British breeds produce the best beef, in my
opinion, if they are allowed to grow on until they are three or more years old.
With the winding down of the OTMS next January, getting our animals finished
by a set age will no longer be vital. There has been too much ‘push’ in farming
in recent times; it will be a pleasure to allow things to go along more naturally
for a change.
The other reason why Jim has chosen a Devon bull this time is more complex.
We farm at present on a very extensive basis, as I have mentioned before in this
column. In fact we are so nearly organic, that Jim is considering converting
to full organic status to take advantage of public demand and the Government
grants that are available just now. I don’t know that he is fully persuaded of the
rights of organic farming. I certainly am not; I have always believed in using all
the technical advances that have been available, but only in moderation. Before
the final decision is made, it will be very interesting to visit some of the organic
farms in our neighbourhood to look at possible pitfalls and the extent of the
paperwork involved, which I believe is horrendous.
Given my scepticism, I am also looking forward to seeing how it pans out,
if Jim does go ahead. Which takes me back to his choice of the Devon breed
for our next bull. In marketing organic beef, possibly privately, taste will be
all-important. And Devon beef has quite rightly the reputation for being the
best. I always remember the late Bill May, of Priorton Barton, probably the
most outstanding breeder of Devon cattle since the war, telling me that the
Angus might be the finest beef breed in the show ring, but nothing could touch
111

2003
the Devon on the plate. I am pleased to see that our bull has Priorton blood
in its ancestry.
And the other reason for choosing the Devon breed when farming organically
is its natural ability to thrive in north Devon. It has after all evolved here, when
some of the modern aids to health were not available to farmers, so it should be
better equipped to deal with weather, worms, fluke, and all the other ills that
can occasionally contrive to make things difficult for us, in what I think is one
of the finest areas in the UK for livestock farming.

August 20th
Godsend of City Money
I see there are reports in the press that more than half the farms sold recently
on the open market have been bought by non-farmers. The implication seems
to be that this is a bad state of affairs, leading to a loss of available farms for
new young farmers, and resulting in the management of land by incompetent
city in-comers. If that is what people are thinking, then I have to say that I
disagree. In fact I would go further and say that it’s a godsend in these difficult
times that big money is available from the sale of overvalued housing in the
home counties to inject into agriculture.
For a start, we keep hearing about the difficulties for older farmers wishing to
retire, with no member of their family intending to take on the business. To have
their old farmhouse, which has probably been a liability all their farming life,
now viewed as an attractive asset by a wealthy townie, must seem like manna
from heaven. Many of these properties are now listed, saddling their owners
with some fiddling regulations preventing them making sensible alterations or
repairs. When I started farming, the quality of the land was all-important. The
farmhouse was viewed solely as living accommodation, which might be so bad
as to make the farm difficult to sell or rent, but could also be freely altered to
keep up with modern life.
When we first came here, our farmhouse was in a very poor state, so much so
that we were seriously advised to bulldoze it down and build a bungalow. It was
a typical Devon farmhouse – old, thatched and longhouse style, but obviously
adapted over the centuries. For a start, the thatch was leaking and the roof
timbers had suffered as a consequence. The bedrooms were in the roof, which
meant they were inter-connected by central doors where the height of the rooms
allowed – thought of as very oldie-worldly today, but a pain in the neck to live
in. So we borrowed some money, got the builders in who threw the whole roof
into the front garden, ancient timbers, thatch and all, and burnt it. The old cob
112

Aug 20th

Godsend of City Money

walls were capped with concrete blocks to raise the upper storey and a new slate
roof was constructed on top. Not without some difficulty, as it happened, since
the walls were far from rectangular when seen without their thatch covering. In
fact it appeared that each main room of the house had been added in different
centuries, with the original being a one-room shack back in the dark ages.
No doubt, I must sound like some destructive philistine today, but in the
1950s, with no planning permission that I was aware of, what we had done was
considered a splendid improvement by all my farming neighbours. Nor was it
anything new. The farmhouse on the neighbouring farm where my brother-inlaw lives, was built in the 1870s by a rich businessman. Squire Gamlin, as he was
known, demolished whatever house was there then, and put up a three-storey
square Victorian house, complete with cellars, servants- quarters and all. He
also built a magnificent set of stone buildings round a central yard with all the
requirements of a model farm. I have no idea what it must have cost, but there
is no way a three hundred acre farm could have financed such an undertaking
even if farming had been profitable at that time, which it certainly was not.
The 1870s was the start of a depression far worse than we are in now. But
there is plenty of evidence that there were many wealthy industrialists around
who were keen to go farming, and invest in new houses and buildings, and live
the country life. In the case of the Gamlins, they lived there for some years
- happily judging by old photographs of horse riding and tennis - with a farm
foreman managing the farm. Mrs Gamlin actually took a keen interest in the
woodland, adding many specimen trees that are now, unfortunately, getting
to the end of their lives, but which would have been more than the ordinary
working farmer would have bothered with.
The family eventually moved on after comparatively few years, I presume
when the children grew up, and the farm was let to a local farming family, and
then sold back into normal circulation. My in-laws bought it at the beginning
of the war, when the house and buildings were still very usable, although now
60 years later, that style of Victorian house is not as comfortable to live in,
and the farm buildings are completely outdated. The land has always been
in very good heart, and the few years of non-yeoman farmer occupation were
nothing but beneficial. As I mentioned earlier, similar situations have occurred
often when farming is depressed, bringing in new people, new thinking and for
those of us anxious to stay in the industry, new opportunities. Young farmers
should grab the chance to manage these farms, or rent the surplus acres that
otherwise would not come on the market. And, most importantly, the planning
authorities should allow new house-building on farms where the old farmhouse
113

2003
is too costly to maintain for a farming business, but is ideal for the lucky few
who have won the lottery, or have a small flat to sell in London.

August 27th
Townies Must Stop Pollution
With the harvest safely out of the way, last week saw the start of muck spreading
and the clearing out of the cow yards ready for winter. Our pastures are very
dry again and hopefully the weather will change in the coming week as they
are forecasting, but even if we get torrential downpours we should have no
problems with runoff. We are fortunately just outside the ‘nitrate sensitive
zone’ which, for some obscure reason, covers most of northwest Devon. Since
changing from a dairy herd to suckler beef cattle, we have been able to avoid
using any outdoor concrete as feeding areas and have thus stopped producing the
sloppy slurry, which has become such a nightmare for many cattle farmers. Two
of our neighbours, with large dairy herds, are now using equipment that injects
the slurry directly into the ground, which must greatly reduce the possibility of
water pollution and certainly avoids that horrendous pong, which can permeate
the countryside when slurry is sprayed into the air, as it normally is.
I remember, some years ago, visiting the Grassland Research Institute at
North Wyke to see some experimental work they were doing, to try and take
the smell out of pig and cow slurry, which was beginning to be a real nuisance to
people living in the countryside. I think it involved prolonged aeration with the
addition of various neutralising agents and seemed to be showing some success,
but as usual in all such work, the cost at farm level looked to be the determining
factor. I don’t know if they ever got slurry coming out smelling of roses, but if
they did, no slurry-spreading farmer that I am aware of has managed it yet.
In our case, the farmyard manure is extremely dry and more straw than
muck. The very strict rules on animal cleanliness which we now have to follow
for cattle going for slaughter, has meant that the amount of straw we bed the
cows in has gone through the roof, reminiscent of the bull shed in ‘Cold Comfort
Farm’. If we were following the best practice methods of organic husbandry, I
suppose we should be carting all the FYM out into an enormous heap and then
carefully inverting it every week until it was properly rotted down to smell-less
compost. The expense involved for us really couldn’t be justified, although
when I started farming, something along these lines was the normal way of
farming.
Cattle manure used to be heaped up every day in the middle of the farmyard
with a wheelbarrow from the cowsheds. Come the following autumn, it was
114

Aug 27th

Townies Must Stop Pollution

taken out in butt carts and dumped in evenly spaced heaps in whichever grass
field was due for manuring, or on the autumn stubbles of those fields going into
root crops the following year. Eventually, when these heaps were sufficiently
rotted down, some poor youngster would find himself endlessly spreading FYM
with a dung-fork – I don’t think I’m being sexist if I omit ‘or herself’, girls were
not stupid enough to get stuck with that job in my young days’. Even today I
find the smell of ammonia can bring back the memory of frosty mornings, when
I was a seventeen year old, standing in a field of gently steaming heaps, and
wondering if my boss was likely to find me something less boring to do before
nightfall.
The advent of the mechanical spreader has changed all that. And although
I always reckon times in farming change for the better, when it comes to smell,
I have to admit the exception. Even our very dry, strawy manure spread thinly
over all our grass ground and corn stubbles does produce a strong, if tolerable,
hum for a few days. I haven’t heard of any complaints from our non-farming
neighbours as yet, but smell, together with noise, are probably the most likely
causes of ill-feeling between farmers and new in-comers, which the drift of population back into the countryside will have to deal with.
Noise, especially traffic noise, is a modern nuisance which urban society is
increasingly inflicting on rural life. Tractor noise is marginal by contrast. We
are very lucky here to live and farm with virtually no traffic noise at all. How
people survive near motorways or airports, I cannot imagine. We are not doing
much about it either. It was noticeable as we crossed northern Europe by coach
on our way to Poland this year, how seriously our European neighbours take the
problem. There was miles of ‘noise shuttering’ made of a variety of materials,
and sometimes rather garishly coloured, on both sides of the road not only
past the towns but wherever there was a small village or even hamlet within
any great distance of the traffic noise. The UK is lagging a long way behind.
Those other evils – light pollution from towns and cities, and visual pollution
in the shape of badly planned urban development, wind farms and aerials of
every description, we can, I suppose, shut our eyes to. But smell, unfortunately,
really gets up people’s noses. If farmers like my neighbours are doing their best
to overcome the worst excesses of that in the countryside, it would be nice to
think that townsfolk were making an effort to tackle the pollution they cause.

Trimmers Have Saved Hedgerows
Why do we make such a fuss about the English hedgerow? It doesn’t matter
what we do in the countryside, if we so much as touch a hedgerow every one
is up in arms. Just now we are trimming the hedges too early according to
one national newspaper, and depriving the birds of the blackberries that are so
plentiful this year. Badgers and foxes seem to be enjoying them as well, judging
by the droppings I see in the fields everywhere, but I can’t believe blackberries
play a vital part in the diet of any animal, just the equivalent of an after-dinner
sweet.
People seem to forget that the sides of hedges have always been trimmed at
this time of year, in fact a good deal earlier than this when the work was done
by hand. Traditionally it used to be a job that was fitted in between haymaking
and harvest. What is more, hedges were pared as close to the hedge-banks as
possible to make life easier, with little more than grass growing on the sides
of most Devon hedgerows and precious few blackberries. I do remember, with
relish, many more wild strawberries in the hedges in those days, which obviously
preferred this management, while blackberries could always be found along the
edges of woodland.
Many of our hedges had nothing other than grass growing on top as well,
with a single strand of barbed wire set at a specific distance to prevent cattle from digging out the banks with their horns – it is sometimes forgotten
that all cattle, apart from one or two naturally polled breeds, were equipped
with what were sometimes fairly formidable weapons capable of demolishing a
hedge in short order. Hedges that were being laid-in after many years upward
growth were often topped with turves covering the woody material completely,
which eventually regrew through this grassy layer. The angle of the bank was
all-important – hence the expression ‘steeping’ for repairing lengths of Devon
hedgerow.
Producing an easily maintained stock-proof field boundary was what mattered. No one was in the least concerned about appearance or the needs of
wildlife. In fact if I had suggested to my neighbour that he was trimming his
hedge too early and depriving birds of blackberries, he would have thought I
was a lunatic. As the number of people working in farming declined, maintaining hedges became increasingly expensive, and many hedges were removed and
replaced with fencing purely for economy, as well as the gradual enlargement
of field size which farm machinery forced on us. The advent of hedge-trimmers
changed all that, and, I think probably saved many miles of hedgerow, before
116

Sep 3rd

Trimmers Have Saved Hedgerows

the laws protecting them were introduced. This farm certainly lost many of its
hedges over the years for a variety of reasons. I recall speaking at a tourism
conference some years ago on ‘the changing countryside’, which I illustrated
with some slides. I showed pictures of fields where hedges had been removed
in the past, and was subsequently slammed by Robin Page, who was speaking
after me, for my rural vandalism. What Robin had missed was my point that
I was talking about our farm in the 1840s and not the 1940s, from information
that had been gleaned from the old tithe maps.
Farms have continually changed through the years. Many fields were enclosed for the first time in the 1740s, which actually deprived people of the very
open access that is now being demanded. I have certainly removed some of our
hedges since I came, in order to be able to make a living. The average field size
here in 1950 was about four acres and it is now just under eight acres – not
exactly prairie farming. Some fields had a hedge at the bottom of the steepest
section, which a horse didn’t worry about, but was impossible to manage with a
tractor. However, I do sometimes wonder whether hedge-trimmers are altering
the appearance and makeup of our Devon hedges. Some hedge plants obviously
recover better than others from the annual thrashing that a modern trimmer
inflicts. The first trimmers, which were really old ‘finger’ grass- mowers in an
upright position, were much kinder to the new growth but required a lot of
clearing up after them. The flail-trimmer, which throws all the cut material
back into the hedge, has completely taken over and with its ability to cut down
anything from a blade of grass to a telephone pole, seems to have even banished that wildly dangerous looking implement, the circular saw on the end of
a boom.
I would like to know if anyone has done any research into changes in the
species of shrubs that dominate our hedgerows now. In other parts of the
country there are often single species hedges, which I find exceedingly boring,
and ours in Devon, with their uniform square top and sides, are perhaps going
the same way. Beech and thorn seem to flourish with a routine flailing, but
ash, one of our commonest hedge plants, can look pretty sick for a time. We
are at the beginning of a ten-year stewardship scheme that requires us to trim
our hedges in only two years out of five. An ash can become a small tree in
three years and I cannot believe it will enjoy being hacked off at these intervals.
Time will tell.

No End to Loony Legislation
We had a dead sheep the other day. If you’re a sheep farmer I know what you’re
thinking - nothing remarkable in that. Sheep have an extraordinary talent for
dying. They can be as happy as ‘Larry’ one day and dead, cold and squabbled
over by a couple of crows the next. Actually I find that a distinct advantage
over some other farm animals, as anyone with experience of downer cows would
agree. Dying before looking ill often avoids a lingering death accompanied by
injections and drenches, and their owner the cost of the vet. OK, before BSE, a
dead cow might fetch a tenner from the knacker, but five minutes with a ditcher
for the sheep and the life of the farm went on as normal.
But not now. This was the first animal we had lost since July 1st and
burial was no longer an option, although I confess it was tempting. “Ring the
knacker,” said Jim, “and see what they’ll charge”. In all the years I don’t ever
remember getting the knacker out for one sheep. £25 collected, I was told,
or £10 if we brought it down ourselves. We were too busy, so the sheep was
collected the next day. It probably cost us more dead than it was worth alive.
I confess it crossed my mind, in a frivolous moment, to ring DEFRA and ask if
we could use a taxi.
As usual with regulations of this sort, the powers that be always take things
to the extreme. I can understand the concern about having carcases buried
any old where, but there will be occasions when people with money troubles
and shortage of feed, will take the law into their own hands and bury carcases
hurriedly in the wrong places just to get them out of sight. And that is just what
this law was introduced to avoid. I very much doubt if the authorities will be
able to prevent it happening. After all, as my old friend Robert Persey reminded
me recently, they never prevented the Northumbrian pig farmer from failing to
sterilise swill properly and so starting the FMD outbreak. And they could and
should have done, and may yet regret not doing so. Robert is supporting a
bankrupt pig farmer who is bringing a case against DEFRA for failing in their
regulatory duty in this instance, which is due for hearing in the High Court on
Oct 2nd.
Robert, if he gets his teeth into something he considers discriminatory or
unfair, does not let go, as those who know him will agree. His extensive pig
enterprise, which was very badly hit by ‘D’ notices during those terrible times,
was eventually given up, handing over more of our pig industry to other countries. But Robert’s disgust with the way DEFRA is handling things has not
diminished. He phoned me to see if I was aware of the extraordinary situa118

Sep 17th

Wake up to Loss of Rural Life

tion that has arisen through the regulations governing the disposal of catering
waste. Apparently it is now possible, since July 1st, for the composting of this
waste, which includes meat products, to end up for its final three months of
decomposition in open fields, albeit with farm livestock excluded. It seems that
with individual items of waste allowed up to 40 cms in diameter, we may find
whole legs of pork scattered round the landscape thanks to scavenging foxes
or badgers. With a large proportion of pig products in catering now sourced
from abroad, one wonders who dreamed up this scheme. I begin to wonder if I
misunderstood Robert’s phone call.
However, reading a letter from a DEFRA Veterinary Officer in this month’s
Devon Smallholder Magazine, I realize that it is probably all too true. The letter reminds owners of livestock that they are not permitted to compost kitchen
waste on their premises. There is an exception where the household is totally
vegetarian and poultry are under control. As for feeding kitchen waste to poultry, forget it. I wish now I hadn’t read the letter – I’ve been feeding kitchen
waste to our few free-range hens for years. That’s why our eggs taste better
than any I have ever bought. Are all the owners of dogs and cats in the UK
aware that we can no longer chuck our kitchen waste on the garden compost
heap? I presume we must put it in secure wheely-bins for the council to collect
so that it can end up being officially composted in the open countryside. If we
don’t own a dog or cat, we better make sure our neighbour’s are vegetarian.
And there are more to regulations to come. I see in a recent NFU briefing
that, as from next year, the burning or burying of any agricultural waste will
be prohibited and the use of farm tips will come to an end. We have until Jan
1st to tidy up our farms in the old fashioned way. After that we will have to
leave old sheets of tin and silage polythene lying about, as I am afraid some of
us always have done. The next thing will be the ‘rubbish police’ or am I just
becoming more cynical as I get older?

September 17th
Wake up to Loss of Rural Life
Over the weekend, the World Trade Talks in Mexico collapsed. As always in
these negotiations, it is farm subsidies in Europe and the US that seem to cause
all the trouble. I am sure that every farmer anywhere in the world appreciates
and has experienced at some time the sheer impossibility of trying to make a
living with food being dumped on one’s market at below the cost of production.
We certainly know what it feels like here in Britain. It is why we’ve had farm
subsidies of one sort or another since the last war. People tend to forget that,
119

2003
when the war started, we only had six weeks supply of food in Britain and
were completely dependant on supplies from overseas. Food shortages certainly
focused the mind and in the last 50 years since the war, we have nearly doubled
the amount of temperate food we produce in this country – just about enough
to feed ourselves in the event of a world crisis.
Is this all about to change? Certainly the system of agricultural support for
Europe is undergoing a dramatic transformation. I understood it was driven
by the needs of the developing nations and was aimed at just the sort of WTO
negotiations, which seem to have so dismally failed. Does the man in the street
know or care what is happening? I am not even sure the man in the country lane understands how this will eventually affect our countryside. We are
probably at a turning point in British agriculture as far reaching as the one
that occurred when I started farming. Until the weekend, many of us were
doubtful whether Franz Fischler, the EU Farm Commissioner, would be able
turn Europe completely away from production subsidies. The French were as
usual being particularly obdurate about severing the connection between rural
support and producing food, but I reckon their hopes of blocking change are
slipping away. Within a year or two, if we are to farm solely on the basis of
what it is profitable to produce, I think the British public may be in for a shock.
While the WTO talks were in progress, Patricia Hewitt, the Trade Secretary, made some comments, which were at odds with the position of our Farm
Minister, Margaret Beckett, who had called for environmental issues to be tied
into trade negotiations. Mrs Hewitt said there was no future for the 2.5 billion
small farmers in developing countries – they should hand their farmland over
to “multinational farming conglomerates that could farm it intensively and in a
productive way”. Doubtless, in her mind, what is good for developing countries
is good for us here.
Meanwhile we, like all UK farmers at present, are thinking seriously about
how we prepare for the future. You are probably aware, if you have been reading
these weekly jottings, that we have a herd of suckler cows and a flock of sheep.
In the way we farm, I suspect Mrs Hewitt would think we were a waste of space.
Talking to Jim over the weekend, I am in no doubt that if producing beef
or lamb here does not make a profit after Jan 1st 2005, he will stop producing
it. Just like that – as the late Tommy Cooper would say. And I am sure many
farmers out there are thinking along exactly the same lines. At present, the level
of farm support for the various farm products very largely determines what we
produce.
This year lamb prices have been better, thanks to the weakness of the
pound which has encouraged exports to the continent, and if circumstances
120

Sep 24th

Cider Apples Were Ten Bob a Sack

don’t change, would probably be profitable for us in the future without a ‘ewe
premium’. The trouble is that if everyone thinks like that, the national sheep
flock will expand to the point at which only ‘multinational farming conglomerates’, to use Mrs Hewitt’s phrase, can make a profit. And these conglomerates
will probably be owned by the large supermarket chains, which will ensure a
market for their produce. I suppose we can always work as managers on our
own farms, as is already happening here and to an increasing extent in America.
Our suckler herd, on the other hand, is most certainly not profitable at
present beef prices without ‘cattle premiums’. If we drop it, how do we farm
our land? This is cattle and sheep country, which has produced a landscape
and natural environment everyone seems to appreciate. We might well manage
for a time by selling beef ‘organically’, but we would be back to relying on
Government support to make the transition. Nor do I expect stewardship and
other green-scheme payments ever to be sufficient to keep us farming, if there
is no profit from what we produce.
It may not sound like it, but I am actually not despondent about the future.
As usual, the British public will wake up at the eleventh hour to the realisation
that, if we want a pastoral countryside, we need to pay for it by giving preference
to British food. We may otherwise find ourselves looking at a very different view.

September 24th
Cider Apples Were Ten Bob a Sack
This autumn, as part of our stewardship scheme, we are resurrecting an old
orchard. It is less than half an acre and is really the cider orchard of the neighbouring small farm. When the farm was sold about 40 years ago, the purchaser,
an airline pilot, only wanted half the land and we bought the remaining 30 acres
very cheaply, as no one else was interested. The orchard should have remained
with that farm; it is adjacent to the farmhouse and buildings, but the apple
varieties being all for cider making, the new owner was happy to include it for
convenience on our side of the new boundary.
Being so far from our own farm buildings, the orchard was not much good
as a paddock for ewes when newly lambed, or the odd sickly cow that needed
watching as it recuperated, which aside from producing apples was the normal
use for these small orchards. The apple trees were all pretty mature then and
over time they have faded away. I used to try the odd windfall when I was
checking the cattle in case I had overlooked a nice eater, but with no luck, and
the orchard gradually disappeared under a thicket of brambles, thorn and, by
121

2003
now, quite substantial oak and ash trees. It has become a mini nature reserve,
undisturbed by farm animals or people.
‘Stewardship’ is keen to revive these old orchards, which were once so much
a part of the Devon landscape, but we will replace the apple trees with eaters,
using the old traditional varieties if we can get them. The days when cider
was seen as an essential addition to a farm worker’s wages are only a memory,
although when I first came to Devon, many farmers still made some for themselves. We used to have an acre of cider apples, which produced some handy
pocket money every autumn. The apples were collected off the ground, preferably after the first autumn frost, in old ‘West of England’ sacks and sold to a
local cider-making firm for ten bob a sack. Jenny says she can still remember
the combined smell of sacking, squashed apples and fallen leaves - together with
wood smoke, the smell of autumn.
I did one year make our own cider. Our neighbour, Jasper, always made his
own and after I had sampled it on various occasions, he persuaded me to give
it a go. First I had to acquire a couple of sound barrels - old whiskey or rum
were the ideal, I was assured. Luckily, I had an uncle in the rum trade, and he
kindly sent me down two empty hogsheads by rail. Although Jasper had an old
cider press in the corner of his barn, he took his apples to a farm about four
miles away, which made cider on a communal basis for all in the vicinity.
We had a newly purchased second-hand T 20 Fergie tractor, which had
replaced our ‘spade-lug’ Standard Fordson, so I agreed to save Jasper his usual
horse and cart trip by taking him with all our combined apples and barrels on
an old farm trailer. We set off on the appointed day, heavily loaded, the four
or five barrels lashed to the front lade, the bags of apples stacked up behind
and Jasper perched on top – well over a ton in weight altogether. We took the
shortest route, at Jasper’s direction, through back lanes I had never seen before.
Very foolishly, as we approached a long downhill stretch, I didn’t change down
a gear at the top. Anyone my age will remember that tractors in those days
needed to be stationery to change gear. As we gathered speed, I attempted to
remedy the situation, but with the trailer weighing far more than the tractor,
my efforts to stop merely resulted in a slide that seemed only to increase our
speed and made steering very difficult. I decided to go with the flow and hope
for the best. Half way down the hill, the trailer was bouncing all over the place
and Jasper, who was shouting ‘whoa’ with various expletives which I am sure
his horse would have understood, appeared at a quick glance over my shoulder
to be airborne. The bags of apples were scattering down the road in our wake.
We got to our cider making eventually, although Jasper vowed never to go
with me again. As it happened, it was the only occasion I made my own cider
122

Ongoing Doubts on GM Foods

anyway. I don’t remember too much about the rest of that day either, except
that we sampled a fair bit of the previous year’s vintage, while waiting our turn
with the various new acquaintances I was introduced to.
I thought my ‘scrumpy’ was pretty good, when I was able to try it about a
month later, after it had gone through the fermenting process, although I didn’t
add any meat or the ‘dead rat’ that I was advised was the old-fashioned way of
ensuring success. Jenny reckoned it tasted like vinegar and was undrinkable, but
the various reps that used to call in those days were always very complimentary.
It all went, all 120 gallons of it, by the following autumn, so it can’t have been
too bad.

October 1st
Ongoing Doubts on GM Foods
I mowed our lawn for a change the other day. Jenny normally does the mowing,
but she was away so I thought I better show willing for once. I don’t feel guilty
leaving that job to her; she’s the gardener, it’s only a small lawn and I do my
best to discourage her from bothering. But why do people make such a fuss
about having a lawn that looks like a cross between a bowling green and a green
baize carpet? Any flower that shows its head gets chopped off before it can seed
and, apart from the odd worm for the blackbirds, a lawn provides very little
for wild life. The town gardener invariably has bird feeders hung around to
make up the deficiency, probably filled with the nuts imported from all over the
world.
I believe there are over a million acres of garden in the UK and assuming
half is featureless lawn, what must the starving in the third world think of our
profligate use of land? As farmers, we are slammed for having waving corn with
never a weed showing and silage and hay fields using only one species of grass
and yet a pristine lawn is admired, with little use except to keep our shoes dry
while we barbecue occasionally on a normal summer’s evening.
And what about the waste of fuel and time involved in this frenetic neatness?
Perhaps that is about to change. I believe that a grass that doesn’t need mowing
has already been produced by genetic modification. From the way gardeners
use chemicals, judging by the shelves of any garden centre, while bemoaning the
sprays that drift in over their gardens from the nearest farmer’s field, I don’t
expect it will be long before the advantage of avoiding the weekend chore of
sitting on a motor lawn-mower for an hour after a stressful desk-bound week
will overcome any scruples they may have, by pointing out that no one eats
lawn grass.
123

2003
What will be overlooked is the fact that thousands of tons of garden waste
is annually recycled by County Councils through composting to agricultural
land, including incidentally to organic farms. It is apparently accepted by the
organic licensing associations that garden chemicals are broken down to leave
no residues in compost. Will GMOs be viewed so leniently, one wonders, that
is assuming they are allowed to be grown at all. Of course, if the grass doesn’t
grow, it shouldn’t get into garden waste anyway, but it is only a short step to
weird and wonderful new flowers and shrubs appearing in our gardens, which
would get into composting.
Don’t get me wrong – I’m not really anti gardeners. I have some pretty good
ones in my own family. There are also many beautiful gardens in the region
that are a pleasure to visit. For myself, the smell of flowers is everything. I
am quite happy with roses growing around the house and sweet peas in vases
indoors – without scent, flowers are better wild in the countryside.
My concern is that GM technology may be banned from farming and yet
get into our food unnoticed. Not that I know if eating GM food is dangerous
anyway. The long-term effect of GM on the environment is a very big subject,
which affects everyone, but as a farmer, using the technology to produce food
is a responsibility I can’t dodge. It’s easy to say leave it to society to decide if
it is safe, but farmers are at the sharp end. We have to be satisfied that we are
not poisoning anybody, to sleep easy at night.
It is nine months since I last wrote about genetic technology in this column.
I said then that we couldn’t ignore scientific advances in farming any more
than in any other walk of life. I had a number of people who contacted me
at the time encouraging me to find out more about GMs. I have to confess
that I have learned very little since then that really convinces me either way.
I have attended open meetings, looked at web sites on the Internet and read
any articles that came my way. And I am none the wiser; the so-called experts
seem only to push their own particular point of view. In the circumstances it
is hardly surprising that the public response to the “GM Nation?” debate was
overwhelming opposed. For a nation that has got cheap food practically coming
out of its ears, the ‘precautionary principle’ must rule. In food production today,
we obviously don’t need it. Those who want it most, seem to be the Monsantos
of this world who stand to make a great deal of money.
If you’re thinking I am coming down on the side of public opinion, you are
actually wrong. I am in favour of genetic technology. Not today or tomorrow,
but definitely in the future. I am keen to see what the trials that have been
taking place will tell us. I am a farmer and if there are better ways of producing
food, I want to know about them. And I hope that the politicians don’t just sit

You Can’t Beat Fresh Produce

Canute-like on the shore to demonstrate that they cannot influence the incoming
tide of world trade, but actually use public opinion to introduce the controls
which this technology desperately needs.

October 8th
You Can’t Beat Fresh Produce
“It was one good thing that came out of ‘foot and mouth’ disease”. Not a very
sympathetic remark to anyone whose livestock were slaughtered, but one that I
do hear more frequently as time goes on. The silver linings to those black days.
On this occasion, I was standing in a bustling throng of shoppers last Saturday
at our monthly Crediton farmers market, talking to a friend who came regularly.
Apparently the market was less well attended before it had to be suspended for
the duration of the FMD outbreak. The first time it reopened, it was crowded
with people who had missed it and were afraid it had closed for good. Since
then it seems to have gone from strength to strength – celebrating its fifth
anniversary last week with a visit from the Mayor of Crediton, resplendent
with chain of office, birthday cake and all.
I must confess that when farmers markets started up all over the country, I
admired their efforts to reopen the link between us and the food buying public
and show up the monotony of the supermarkets, but I really didn’t expect them
to survive for long. How farmers like our neighbours, Roger and Dodie Huxter,
find the time and energy to sell at seven or eight markets a month beats me.
They farm over 100 acres, keeping five different breeds of pedigree sheep, and
sell everything they produce either direct or on a market stall. And everything
includes the wool off the sheep’s back, as yarn, throws or sheepskin rugs. Dodie
has found time to act as the Crediton market coordinator for the last two years
and teaches once a week as well.
With nearly 500 farmers markets in the UK now, the taste of farm fresh food
must surely be starting to penetrate the national palate. My worry is that most
of these markets only take place monthly. Visiting towns anywhere in Europe
or America, they are always weekly, which for the sale of fresh food would seem
to be essential. It was a pleasure, therefore, to find the Exeter market last
Thursday has moved right to the centre of the city, in sight of the Cathedral,
where it will continue to be held fortnightly till December and then every week
to Christmas. If the enthusiasm of George Dumble, the General Manager for
Markets and Halls for Exeter City Council, who was in attendance, is any thing
to go by, there will hopefully be a farmers market regularly very week as soon
as may be in the New Year. He would like to see people coming to Exeter to
125

2003
buy fresh food in the market, before going on to the supermarkets to do the
rest of their shopping. And so say all of us.
But what about the Huxters? Can farmers afford the time? I asked Roger
who was there and he jokingly offered me a job as stand-by stallholder. And that
today must be the problem. Most farmers of my generation will remember their
childhood when many farms sold much of their produce direct to the public. It
was the norm and not the exception as it is today. The big difference, which we
can’t overcome, is the number of people involved on farms then - farm workers
on the larger farms and extended families on the smaller.
Jenny’s cousin, Michael, who was evacuated down here from London in the
war, remembers those days very clearly. When their home was flattened by
bombs, his father came down and took a job on the neighbouring farm, which
had a cottage available for the family. The Salters, the tenants of the 350-acre
mixed farm, had a permanent stall in Exeter’s Friday pannier market, which
they had attended for many years. Old Mr Salter was still alive when I first
came to Devon, and used to talk about the old days. Apparently before the
war, they took their produce to Exeter by pony and trap, leaving at five in the
morning and driving up a track through our woods, by permission of the then
landlord, to knock a couple of miles off the 17 mile journey.
By Michael’s time, they had an Austin 16 with a large boot at the back,
which was filled with anything available to sell off the farm. Fat bullocks and
lambs were walked to the local market for sale, but everything else went to
Exeter - pork and bacon, the village butcher slaughtering a pig on the farm
at regular intervals, cream, butter, fruit and vegetables from the garden, eggs,
poultry, rabbits and even wild flowers. Michael’s abiding memory as a boy is
tying up primroses, twelve flowers and four leaves to a bunch, to be sold for six
old pence (at a time when bread was two old pence a loaf). He recalls Mrs Salter
saying that the weekly takings covered the wages of four fulltime men plus the
housekeeping money. I am sure old Mr Salter would not mind me saying that
almost all the work he did was drive to Exeter every week. Big farmers in those
days did little manual work - that would be taking the wages from a potential
farm worker. How things change.

Ben Gill Held His Nerve
The changing colours of autumn are with us again, giving a wonderful look to
the countryside, before the drabness of winter sets in. The reds and browns
and sandstone yellows – no, not the trees, although they are pretty spectacular
as usual, it’s the colour of the newly turned plough land that I really enjoy. I
think this is my favourite time, especially if the barns are full of feed as they
are this year, and the cattle are still out grazing, showing no sign as yet that
they would be happier indoors. Perhaps my only regret nowadays is the speed
with which this special landscape comes and goes, a distant stubble field with
just a ribbon of turned earth at breakfast time and all ploughed by nightfall.
And probably harrowed and drilled in a single pass and showing green again in
a fortnight.
It is also the season of farmer meetings, AGMs and annual dinners. And
when times are hard, as they usually are, of demonstrations at Party Conferences or the docks. This year, the targets for farmer discontent seem to be
the milk processors and quite rightly so. With a carton of fresh milk costing
anything up to 50p a litre in the supermarket and the milk producer receiving
barely a third of that for the contents of the carton, something is rotten in the
state of the industry.
Meanwhile, I read in the farming press that Ben Gill, the NFU President,
has decided that it is time for him to go. He will not be standing for re-election
next February, but will be handing over the top job to a new leader after the
elections, which follow the AGM. Oh yes, there is democracy in the NFU and it
has become more streamlined as the years have gone on. There has been a lot of
criticism in the past, often from non-members or the media, that the ordinary
farmer had little say in who formed the presidential team and that a ballot of
all members should decide. I have never quite understood the logic of that;
how can farmers hope to judge the potential of little known candidates without
an electioneering campaign along the lines of the recent Californian jamboree?
And what does that often produce but a person without substance, or one who
offends the fewest voters?
It is also often overlooked even by NFU members that we all have an equal
vote, postally these days, for our electoral college, the NFU Council, regardless
of the size of our farm or subscription rate. Not that I am suggesting the internal
workings of the NFU are perfect, far from it. I have been criticising them for
years, but from inside as a member, unlike some. It is to Ben Gill’s credit that
substantial changes have been made during his time as an office holder, even to
127

2003
the recent decision to move the head quarters out of the centre of London, to a
location nearer to the centre of the country.
It is much too early to judge his presidency; he has four months yet to
complete, with vital decisions on the details of decoupling farm support to agree
and push through against possible Ministerial opposition. But no one can deny
that the going didn’t get pretty rough at times, with BSE, GMOs, increasingly
powerful supermarkets, and the most horrendous outbreak of FMD in living
memory. There was a spell when the weight of public opinion, including that
of many farmers, must have been almost unbearable. I refer to the decision
to hold out against vaccination to prevent FMD overwhelming us. I confess I
thought at the time he was wrong. One of my lasting memories of him will be
the ‘News Night’ interview with Jeremy Paxman, at the height of the debate.
The introductory shots were of Tony Blair and Ben Gill coming out of No 10,
Downing Street, and Jeremy remarking that we were seeing two men, one of
whom would decide the date of the General Election, the other being the Prime
Minister. I doubt that any NFU President has ever been so close to the eye of
a political storm or had more influence on its outcome. He certainly held his
nerve on that occasion and he was proved right – we were through the worst
of the disease and the vaccinate-to-kill policy, which was all we were offered,
would have involved the slaughter of many more animals.

October 22nd
Who Left Our Gate Open?
If cattle are going to get out, why do they always do it on a Sunday, or worse
still on Christmas day? About 40 cows and calves came wandering down our
lane last Sunday morning before we were out and about. We farm both sides of
a long narrow Devon lane, with a high proportion of our fields opening on to it.
It has been an advantage over the years providing us with easy access, but it has
the disadvantage that any accidental breakout can result in animals wandering
theoretically to anywhere in the county. Luckily our animals are very territorial
and generally come back to the farm buildings, as they did that morning. The
worst scenario occurs when a car gets the wrong side of them and keeps on
going. The first we know about it is a phone call from a neighbour telling us
they can see some cattle heading out of the lane at speed and are they ours.
This may all sound as if it’s a frequent occurrence, but fortunately it doesn’t
happen very often.
When we had a dairy herd, the cows had to be fetched from and taken
back to whichever field they were in twice a day. Looking back on those days, I
128

Oct 22nd

Who Left Our Gate Open?

wonder how many hours of my life I have spent just walking along, rather slowly,
behind a bunch of cattle. Nowadays, with beef cattle, there is still plenty of
walking, but only to check that they are all where they should be. Having them
wander down the lane, as on this occasion, becomes a nuisance rather than the
norm. So how did they get out? And that is the slight worry. The gate of their
field was wide open and it was definitely properly shut the day before. It is
most likely that one of the animals was rubbing itself and somehow managed
to open it, but it is a gate onto a public footpath, one of four such gates in
our lane. The footpath is very rarely walked - in fact I have only ever seen one
couple walking it in the last 50 years. However there is now a ‘public footpath’
sign by the gate, recently erected by the district council.
People living locally know where the footpaths are, and they also know how
the countryside works – to leave gates open which they find open and to shut
any they find shut. For us, this is vital, as our cattle invariably have the run
of two or three fields, and cows with young calves, which may have become
temporarily separated, will jump hedges or knock down gates to get back with
their offspring. It is quite possible for a walker to cross many of our fields
without realising that there are any cattle to worry about at all.
You would be wrong in assuming from all this that I don’t like people using
public footpaths and that the ‘right to roam’ legislation fills me with horror.
I admit I am probably the least welcoming member of my family to seeing
people wandering across fields where there is no right of way, but I like to think
I am very far from the cartoon farmer, red in the face, waving a stick and
shouting from a distance at a nervous mushroomer. I do admit to engaging
passing hikers in polite conversation – where have they come from and where
are they going, what sort of farming goes on round here, and the state of the
agricultural industry generally. I would hate to think so, but it may be that
this has a deterrent effect on their enjoyment of the peace and tranquillity of
the countryside.
For me, the problems arise when large groups of people appear to be invading
our space like some ‘Pilgrims Progress’. You can hear the chatter from a distance
and feel obliged to go and see what is afoot. I am sure it is very selfish on my
part, but a column of 30 or 40 ramblers threading their way across the farm
does fill me with some apprehension. I generally follow them to see that all is
well with the cattle and the gates are properly left open or shut as the case may
be.
In theory, the ‘right to roam’ will not affect us; we have no ground that falls
into the various categories where this will be allowed. In practice, it may be
that walkers, seeing a signpost pointing into fields where there is no obvious
129

2003
footpath, will assume they can go anywhere. People, in ones and twos, who
know the difference between crops and pasture and to keep dogs on a lead
through sheep and off a lead through cattle, will cause no trouble and would,
in fact, be very welcome. The more people who ‘connect’ back with farming,
the more chance we have of being allowed to go on producing the nations food
and make a living. I just hope the media take up the challenge when the time
comes, and ensures that the urban public is fully aware of its responsibilities.

Why Farmers Must Not Become “Park Keepers”
Jenny and I spent a few days last week visiting the Isle of Wight. We never
had much time for holidays in our early days, but in the last 20 years, since
Jim has been managing the farm, we have often taken off at short notice to
wander wherever the fancy took us. We have tried to go somewhere different
each time, never travelling the same route twice, finding a B&B at nightfall,
and avoiding the motorways when possible. I reckon we have been to every
county and almost every district of the UK at one time or another, apart from
Northern Ireland or the Scottish Isles, and up to now, the Isle of Wight. I
think I could write a book about some of the weird B&Bs we have ended up in,
and this trip was no exception. Our third night, near Cowes, was spent with
a lady, who had the biggest collection of exotic birds I have ever seen, larges
cages all round the garden and small cages filling four or five sheds, with birds
of every colour imaginable. The house was also full of trophies, won at shows
all over the country. I am not too happy at seeing birds kept all their lives
in small cages, when to be able to fly must be one of the greatest freedoms
allowed to any creature; it makes intensive livestock farming look like a fairly
natural existence. We nearly brought disaster with us – we returned after a
meal at a nearby pub, to find the local fire brigade damping down the embers
of a burnt out derelict shed only a matter of feet from the end of the garden
and the nearest aviary. No doubt, our hostess will remember our night’s stay
as long as we shall.
We returned home driving north through the New Forest, which we have
explored in the past. I am always struck by the fact that this is probably
the largest area of lowland England that has remained relatively unchanged
for the last thousand years. It is very much how I imagine all of England
would have looked, if increasingly intensive farming had never happened. An
England covered with woodland, and woodland clearings, is easy to visualise,
but large areas of lowland heath, as in the New Forest, is something else again.
130

Why Farmers Must Not Become “Park Keepers”

It brings home to one what the countryside could revert to, if the rather fanciful
idea that we should import all our food cheaply and become park keepers ever
became reality. I know it is a wonderful wildlife habitat, and is to some extent
a managed landscape, but I find heath land can be very boring to look at. For
a start, there is not a single hedgerow to break the monotony of the view, since
without farming there is absolutely no requirement for a hedge. Nor is there
any need for areas of wildflower hay meadows or poppy spattered cornfields, if
that’s what the public want, to break up what would actually look like a kind
of much-maligned prairie.
The remainder of our trip was through beautiful, although this year, very
dry farmland. The view as we emerged from Cranborne Chase, high up looking
north across Wiltshire, autumn sown cornfields showing brightly, interspersed
with untilled plough and the shabby green of tired pasture, was worth the trip
on its own. I don’t think you will see anything like it anywhere else in the
world. You will have guessed what I was thinking about as we drove on home –
the mid term farm review. The hot topic of the day is whether farmers should
be paid a flat rate for every acre they farm, even if they do no more than mow
their fields once a year and produce nothing but bare grass. Or whether they
should be paid off over a ten-year period based on the level of support they
have each individually received in the past. Because when all’s said and done,
that’s what it amounts to.
In my opinion, it’s no contest. How does a flat rate payment for all farm
land really equate with a non-subsidised agriculture, when sitting round the
table with third world countries at WTO meetings, which is what I thought
this was all about. At least an historic based payment can be seen as a form
of redundancy for the notion of ‘featherbedding’ farmers, not that it ever really
was like that – more a case of keeping down food prices for underpaid factory
workers after the war. Better still, it would allow older farmers, with no next
generation taking over, to retire with a tradable asset, which a flat rate system
denies.
It doesn’t make much difference to us which method is finally decided on. I
calculate that we would be slightly better off at a flat rate, as we’ve been farming
very extensively in recent years. But I would be very disappointed if DEFRA
opts for it for the sake of simplicity. Whatever method of rural support might
be introduced in the future, an historic based system should make it absolutely
clear to farmers and public alike, that production subsidies are finally a thing
of the past.

Importance of Saving Our Hedges
Last week was ‘Devon Hedge Week’. Jenny and I went along to two of the
nearest demonstration farms to see how our hedges compared with those of
the experts. The first was Lower Ash Moor, Rose Ash, near South Molton,
belonging to Cyril Cole. I had been on a farm walk there some ten years
ago, after he had won FWAG’s ‘Silver Lapwing Award’, a national award for
conservation plus successful commercial farming. Listening to Cyril as I walked
round then, he seemed more interested in the pedigrees of his Friesian dairy
cows, than the number of birds or wildflowers his farming was encouraging. I
was very keen to see how the wildlife side of his farm had developed since then
- when times get tough, the environment often has to take a back seat.
Well, the wildlife on the farm has certainly not declined since those days, in
fact it almost appears to have taken on a life of its own. The cows have all gone
and the environment is now central to the running of the farm, with a ‘water
resources’ business taking up much of Cyril’s time away from home. If you want
a dowser, it seems Cyril’s your man, and a few more summers like the last one
should make him busier than ever. However I am glad to hear that he is also
involved in giving advice on the conservation side of farming. It is obvious that
in managing hedges for bird life, he is an expert.
Unfortunately this is where schemes like ‘Stewardship’ fall down.

Just

laying-in old rundown hedges, fencing both sides with a metre margin, and
trimming two years in five, is not going to increase bird numbers by very much.
Cyril’s hedges vary according to the birds he is trying to encourage, from a set
height for nesting mistle thrushes to a high hedge against a road to ensure that
barn owls clear passing cars as they fly across. His hedges are predominantly
beech, where ours are mostly ash, which I think require different management
when it comes to hedge-trimming. We are lucky in the south west in having a
huge variety in our field boundaries - plain hedges, hedge banks, stone walls,
you name it, we’ve got it. And in some cases, just plain wire fencing, which is
not very wildlife friendly. I gather that Stewardship is not going to be renewed
after next year, but will be replaced with an upper level to the new broad and
shallow scheme, which is being piloted in the Tiverton area at present.
I just hope that what is introduced will give a great deal more flexibility to
cater for the diversity of our region. I have a horrible feeling that, if not, in
fifty years time all our hedges will end up looking the same, a bit scruffy for
two or three years, and then back to short top and sides in sequence. And I
don’t think that will do a great lot for the birds or any other wild life. I don’t
132

Nov 12th

Our Stock Bull Just Had to Go

much like the appearance of neatly trimmed hedges anyway. Unfortunately it
is the only way we can manage them economically, but I would prefer it if we
were encouraged to let a proportion grow up for twenty or so years, and then
re-laid, which is not offered under current Stewardship. If we’re not careful,
there won’t be enough people capable of laying hedges in twenty years.
The second farm we visited was also a chance to see prize-winning hedges,
but these were very different. Higher Kerscott, Swimbridge, in North Devon was
demonstrating how completely new but traditional Devon hedge-banks could
be reintroduced beside fields or green lanes, from where they had long since
disappeared. The actual banks were made up of spoil from urban development,
delivered by lorry, which would otherwise have had to be disposed of in landfill
sites. After a period to allow for consolidation, the banks were then planted up
with traditional hedge plants. I suppose I could be facetious and suggest that
the number of varieties used should depend on how old, in centuries, the hedge
was that was being replaced. Future archaeologists might also be puzzled about
odd soil types appearing out of sequence, but, joking apart, it looks like a good
way of using waste soil and should produce hedges as good as our ancestors
made with pick and shovel.
It goes to show what we could do to improve our countryside, using the tools
of today. However, I do criticise the way we always tend to look backwards,
when considering how to manage our farm landscape. Why do the public have
this fixation about a patchwork of small fields? Why not much bigger fields in
some areas, bounded by ten-metre wide hedgerows or connecting woodland? I
have a favourite farmland view not five miles from here, where a complete lack
of hedges on undulating pasture is far more beautiful in certain light than the
surrounding small fields. What about a 21st century Devon for people to look
back on?

November 12th
Our Stock Bull Just Had to Go
I’m afraid winter is upon us. Not the weather - I’m referring to the winter chores
of feeding up and bedding down housed cattle. We like to leave the cows with
calves out as long as we can, feeding hay in the field. Ever since they broke out
three weeks ago, thanks to an opened gate, they have refused to settle. With
set stocking, if you once move them, or they move themselves, you’ve had it;
they become determined that the grass is greener on the other side of the farm.
To make matters worse two lots of cows got together, making a group of
about 100, which for us is unmanageable. They will come in this week and the
133

2003
older calves weaned, wormed, and sorted into groups according to size. The
cows will also have to stay in until they accept that their calves have left them
for good. And what a cacophony of bellowing that will produce.
There was one other unforeseen result of the cows getting out. After everything had settled down that morning, we found that our old Simmental stock
bull had decided enough was enough, and rather than chasing after his harem,
had retired to the farm buildings and was happily munching hay. We have had
some doubts about his enthusiasm for the job for some time, but since he has
been a very quiet old boy, always ready to have his back rubbed when passing,
we have put off the evil day.
Jim now decided the time had come to bite the bullet. We discovered this
was not as simple as it used to be. It is over a year since we disposed of
any breeding cattle, and I was unaware there was no longer an abattoir in
Devon licensed to take OTMS animals; the nearest is over 60 miles away at
Bridgewater. For a heavy old bull, somewhat tender in the feet, that distance
is quite unacceptable. Our vet certified him as unfit to travel, although fit
for human consumption, which allowed us to have him put down by our local
knacker.
The lorry from Tellams Incineration, a firm we have used for many years,
duly arrived, and the very experienced slaughter man dispatched the bull instantly. It died with a mouth full of rolled oats which it was eating from a bucket,
without having the least inkling of what was afoot. After we had completed the
paper work, which took longer than dealing with the bull, the unpleasant job
was done.
I recount this rather gruesome side of farm life for a very good reason. We
have always tried to have our animals killed as humanely as possible. Perhaps
one-day we may again have them slaughtered on farm for human consumption. I
realise that at present this is only a pipe dream; until then, they should be killed
as close to home as we can arrange. I know BSE and food hygiene regulations
have placed a ridiculous burden of veterinary inspection costs on the smaller
slaughterhouses, but why can’t we use the animal welfare grants, proposed in
the CAP reform, to stop any more being closed down? This is surely more
deserving than some of the new environmental grants.

A Rotten Lot of Ministers

November 19th
A Rotten Lot of Ministers
A week ago Lord Haskins published his report on the working of the Department
for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs – ‘DEFRA’ to you and me. It used
to be called MAFF, but the name change made little difference down on the
farm. The report was well covered in this paper, and I won’t bore you by
repeating any details; suffice to say the Department is in a mess. Lord Haskins,
you will remember, is the Prime Minister’s adviser on what goes on in the
countryside. He is the ex-boss of Northern Foods and happens to own a farm,
so in Blair’s eyes must be well qualified. He once famously said that all small
farmers were destined for the scrap heap; the implication being that, if they
wished to stay in the food industry, they would be better employed stocking
supermarket shelves. He may well be right but I hope he resists the temptation
to follow the example of so-called experts, who end up on Government advisory
bodies ensuring their predictions come true.
However, since this report had been a whole year in the making, I thought it
worthwhile to look in the DEFRA website to see if by any chance our Ministry,
whatever name it might go under, was due for a glorious ‘renaissance’. The full
report was there alright, all 628 Kilobytes of it. I am not sufficiently computer
literate to know how many words that comes to, but I suspect a hell of a lot. If,
by putting that information at the start of the document, the intention was to
discourage ordinary farmers like me from reading it closely, it certainly worked,
but from my brief scan through it, it looks as if nothing much will change.
Lord Haskins seems to be shuffling the same old pack of cards; he wants to
get rid of one of the quangos that currently oversee the countryside, but set up
another bigger one, which will include developing an integrated rural database,
whatever that means. IACS big brother, perhaps!
Where Lord Haskins does deserve some credit is his scathing attack on the
present set-up, although I am surprised it took him so long. What is even
more surprising is the immediate reaction of our Minister in charge of rural
affairs, Margaret Beckett. She welcomes the report, which she claims to have
commissioned in the first place. She is very quick to demand that it is not seen
as a criticism of staff and she is going to take until the spring to answer it, when,
I presume, she hopes we will have forgotten all about it. I conclude therefore
that she takes full responsibility for the current shambles. She is after all the
boss. Not only that - two and a half years ago she was put in charge of setting
up DEFRA and has been in charge of it ever since. On the basis of this report, I
don’t give too much for her chances of lasting till spring any way. Why doesn’t
135

2003
the Prime Minister immediately replace her? Perhaps no one is willing to take
on the job? What about Lord Haskins – presumably as a life peer he would be
eligible? At the end of his report he has demanded that “progress reports on
the implementation of his recommendations be published in the spring of 2004,
2005, 2006 & 2007”. Let him do it himself – I don’t expect it will make any
difference to any of us.
And that is the real problem for farming, the countryside, rural life and
everything connected to it. We haven’t had a good heavyweight Minister in
charge for a long time now. I remember one that went on to be Chancellor of
the Exchequer and another who became Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,
but they were the exceptions. Recently they have either been ‘no hopers’ that
were never going any further, or ‘old timers’ on the way out. Ted Heath started
the rot when he handed our fishing industry over to Europe and promised De
Gaulle that he would downgrade the importance of food production in the UK,
if he could get his signature on our treaty of accession to the EU. Maggie
Thatcher didn’t help matters either by reducing our civil service, especially
the veterinary department, to a shadow of its former self. John Gummer, her
Agriculture Minister, compounded our problems by accusing other European
States of cheating in their subsidy claims, and gold-plating our own regulations
to avoid being accused in return.
Everything has gone down hill ever since. Remember Douglas Hogg, dressed
as Ned Kelly, trotting round Europe behind John Major trying to get our beef
market back on track? Or Jack Cunningham, the enforcer, refusing to go anywhere rural, in case he might encounter a real, mud-encrusted farmer. The
same couldn’t be said of Nick Brown. He was happy to go wherever he was
invited, but he never actually did anything. ‘Foot and Mouth’ proved that, and
there followed one defining moment when a Prime Minister took charge of our
industry. I held my breath at the time to see what Tony Blair would make of it,
but I shouldn’t have bothered. He saw his danger, and was gone in an instant.

November 26th
Clubs Give Guidance
Jenny and I enjoyed a very pleasant evening last week as guests of the Launceston & District Farmers Club at their annual dinner and dance. There is something about Cornish farmers when they get together that is very welcoming. I
don’t think I’ve any Cornish blood in me, but I always feel I’m joining a big
family gathering when across the Tamar for a meeting, show or social occasion.
Jenny, although born in Devon, is pure Cornish so perhaps that’s where the
136

Nov 26th

Clubs Give Guidance

family feeling comes from. Then again, it may be that the farming community
spirit remains stronger in Cornwall than the other southwest counties.
The Dinner was very well attended, with getting on for 150 people present.
I was told that there had been nearly 250 at the Wadebridge Club Dinner
the previous week, which is a staggering turnout in these troubled farming
times, but perhaps that was a reflection on the fact that Launceston had only
been going since the end of the last war. Wadebridge had been founded 100
years before that, which gives them a bit of a head start. With such a strong
membership in social clubs like these, there is no way the spirit of farming is
likely to die, what ever the future throws at us.
The important part of the evening was the prize presentation for the winners
of the various club competitions. The top table was weighed down with about 25
silver cups that are awarded annually for virtually every thing that happens or is
produced on a farm - from grassland to crops, livestock, machinery maintenance,
labour saving, and even tidiest farmyard and flower garden. And unlike a local
flower or vegetable show, the winners and runners-up seemed to be different
farmers for almost every category. I was staggered by the sheer effort that must
have gone into the organising and judging during the year. Talk about farm
assurance, I wonder if the public is aware how much pride still exists among
farmers in doing the job well in the eyes of their peers.
It was quite a comedown to receive through the post the day after our night
out, a reminder from FABBL, the farm assurance organisation to which we
belong, that our subscription for next year was due. It was accompanied by a
glossy 56-page producer manual, to make sure we knew of the new and updated
standards we must meet before our annual inspection.
It also advised us to talk to our “abattoir or market customer” if we were
considering not renewing our membership. In other words, we might lose the
chance of our produce carrying the Little Red Tractor Logo. I wouldn’t want to
decry the effort that is collectively being put into establishing an identity for UK
produced food, but do the public really care that much about farm assurance?
I am all for something that is easily recognisable on the packaging of our food
when it is not being sold under a well known British brand name, but I have
some difficulty in quickly finding the little red tractor, and I am looking for it.
What a pity it isn’t at least a BIG red tractor. I doubt many townies get past
the price tags – they’re hard enough to evaluate.
The essential parts of the farm assurance schemes that the supermarkets,
and I suppose therefore the public, are concerned about are compliance with
regulations on food safety and animal welfare. These are already covered by
law. I would accept an annual check-up to see if we have a livestock movement
137

2003
book, medicines records, chemical security and so on, but lately an element of
nit-picking is creeping in – the list of protocols, as they are called, seems to be
growing by the year. In practice, a qualified inspector with farming experience
could see at a glance whether the animals were comfortable and well cared for.
I like corned beef - I am a child of wartime rationing. I generally look at the
bottom of the tin to see if it came from Brazil or Argentina. It does sometimes
cross my mind how much space that bullock had to lie down in. Probably half
a rain forest. As a farmer I feel a bit guilty, but I still buy it. I bet the ordinary
shopper never even checks the origin, and there is no encouragement from the
supermarket to do so.
If there was a difference in the price paid by our retailers, I could understand
the logic of it all. If food is British, it is deemed necessary to have it stringently
assured. If it comes from anywhere else, we just take it on trust. At present
there is plenty of food in the world if you live in a rich country. If ever there
is a real shortage, and the signs are all there that one-day there may be, farm
assurance will go out of the window overnight. The lasting assurance that we
produce food to high standards lies in the existence of organisations like the
Launceston & District Farmers Club and long may they continue.

December 3rd
Auctions Used to Be Fun
Farm sales aren’t what they used to be. For one thing, there are nothing like
so many as when I started farming 50 years ago. In those days, there would be
three or four local sales every spring and autumn, which one attended almost
as a social occasion. It was a chance to meet the neighbours, and, at the same
time, see round a farm that had otherwise only been viewed over the hedge
when passing. If there were two or three hundred people present, it was a very
good sale indeed.
Until the other day, I hadn’t been to a sale for a couple of years. I was
staggered, therefore, to find fields full of cars and over a thousand people milling
around in the mud – it had rained heavily overnight – when I went along to a
farm sale about five miles from here. The farm had been in the same family for
three generations, so I doubt there had been a sale there in living memory. There
were store cattle and sheep, a good selection of machinery and implements, and
the usual accumulation of farm paraphernalia, which seems to appear from
nowhere on these occasions, plus a few bits of furniture. It wasn’t a sale of
pedigree animals so why there was such a crowd from all over Devon I have no
idea.

Auctions Used to Be Fun

For the sake of the outgoing farmer, I was pleased it was a successful day.
There was such a throng round the auctioneer, it was difficult to hear how much
the lots were going for, or even what they were. I know the value of money
is relative, but I was amused when a second-hand dung spreader fetched more
than I paid for our farm. And a little grey TVO Fergie, looking its age but still
sounding sweet enough, made £200 more than I gave for a new one in 1952.
Occasions like these inevitably remind me of the old days. When we started
farming, I went to all the local sales within easy distance to collect the necessary
implements and tools we needed. Buying new would have been an unthinkable
extravagance. I clearly remember my first sale, where I was hoping to buy a
tractor mower, which we had to have before the hay season started. I was a
complete stranger to everyone present and I had never made a bid for anything
in my life, so I should think my nerves were pretty obvious. The mower was
in poor condition and I had no idea of its value. As the bidding progressed, I
couldn’t work out who I was bidding against and I found myself taking longer
and longer to come back each time. The price seemed to be going way over the
top but, oh, how I needed that mower. It was knocked down to me in the end,
but I was left with the strong suspicion that no one else actually wanted it. As
a greenhorn college boy farmer, the locals were making sure I knew my place.
The mower was never much good, but the lesson was invaluable. Make up your
mind what your limit is before you start and bid quickly, putting the pressure
on the other guy.
I have been to countless farm sales since then, enjoyed the company, and
sometimes in the early days picked up a real bargain. My particular speciality
was kitchen tables. In those days, farm sales nearly always included the contents
of the farmhouse, which were auctioned in situ. As the last few rolls of sheep
netting or boxes of assorted spanners were being knocked down outside, there
was a general rush, especially by the ladies, into the house, to get a good
vantage point close to the first lot in the parlour. You could then move with the
auctioneer from room to room – in a small house, the squash was sometimes
unbelievable. I discovered, quite early on, that as the sale of the last items
downstairs - the cutlery laid out on the kitchen table - was reaching a conclusion,
there was a rapid move up to the first bedroom, the stairs being seen as a
possible bottleneck. If I remained behind, I often found myself the sole bidder
for the kitchen table itself, which had been overlooked. Professing that I was
not in the least interested, I would offer half a crown, as a favour, to allow the
auctioneer to get on upstairs. I must have bought half a dozen in my time, the
unusually long one now in our farmhouse kitchen setting me back a princely
fifteen bob.

2003
There were times when the farmhouses were just too small for everyone to
get inside, and bids would float in through the windows. There would be shouts
as to which lot was being bid for, and I’ve no doubt people often found they had
bought something unseen they hadn’t intended to. I have an oil painting today,
which I bought then for less than a pound, described as an old picture and bid
for through several intermediaries from the lawn. I would be very surprised if
it was an undiscovered old master, but the frame was certainly a bargain. TV
programmes like “Going for a Song” have put paid to all that.

December 10th
Mushrooms Appeared in November
My comments last week about farm sales in the 50’s, and the squash of people
crowding into the farmhouse when the furniture was being auctioned, evoked
some amusing anecdotes from readers. I say amusing, although they probably
weren’t very funny at the time. Jenny remembers that her sister was at a sale,
where the bedroom floor slowly gave way under the weight of the people present,
fortunately without injury. And Richard Knight, a long time farming friend,
writes that he was often told by locals of the occasion years before, when the
floor of a large sitting room in his farmhouse, with about 40 people bidding for
the furniture, fell six feet into the cellar below. I heard from another reader of
the time a cob wall partially disintegrated under pressure from the floor joists,
exposing an entire network of rat holes like some giant Gruyere cheese.
I wonder, in these instances, whose insurance picked up the bill for the
damage - the outgoing farmer’s or the auctioneers’. Or perhaps in those days,
when so many farms were tenanted, the landlord’s. Maybe that is the reason
why sales no longer involve the interior of the farmhouse. And, on the whole, I
am glad. I may have implied, last week, that a jolly time was had by all, but I
was always saddened to think of an old couple, at the end of their farming life,
having strangers picking through their memories, the furniture and knick-knacks
that accumulate through the years. Very often it was due to the death of a
spouse that had caused the sale, with the survivor moving on to live with family,
who could find room for one parent, but not the accompanying belongings.
Nowadays, at this stage in our lives, we move into a small bungalow or flat and
help inflate the national housing shortage.
Meanwhile, back on the farm, winter is upon us. All the cattle are now
indoors, except the dry suckler cows that stay out on our hill field until they
calve, which they always seem to do better outside with plenty of exercise. The
ewe flock, not due to lamb until after Christmas, are grazing the corn stubbles.

Threat of Bold Badgers

This is unusual for us, since we normally follow winter corn with winter corn.
This year, to give the land a break, the corn ground is being leased to grow
swedes for human consumption, and will not need ploughing until early spring.
With our reduced cattle numbers, we will hopefully have enough feed-corn to
carry us through two winters, and if the straw doesn’t hold out that long, we
can always buy-in some, even though we may have gone ‘organic’ by then inorganic straw being allowed for bedding.
As a footnote to what I shall look back on as an extraordinary summer,
for the first time in years we found no mushrooms in any of our fields, until
suddenly they appeared in the middle of November. There wasn’t a surfeit as
there generally is, but we were getting a small basketful every few days until
the end of that month. Certainly a record on this farm, but is this just a one
off, or more evidence of global warming?

December 17th
Threat of Bold Badgers
I travelled up to the AGM last week of Quality Milk Producers Ltd, the farmer
cooperative that represents producers milking Jersey and Guernsey cows. Although I’m no longer a dairy farmer, I have been a member for most of the fifty
years the Company has been in existence, and I enjoy attending the annual
meeting to meet old friends and hear the views of today’s CI milk producers.
The wretched milk price and the uncertainties of the CAP reforms were
obviously topics for conversation, but I was very alarmed at the despondency
shown by farmers who had been hit by TB breakdowns. In a couple of the
more serious cases, one farmer, with 30 cows being slaughtered as reactors out
of a herd of 60, was seriously considering giving up altogether, and another
was having severe problems with overstocking, only able to sell bull calves for
immediate slaughter.
We have been very fortunate in never having had a reactor in all the years
we have been here, but we would not be hit so hard financially now with beef
cattle. Dairy farming is in enough trouble at present, without having TB to
contend with. And what makes it worse is the continuing determination of the
Government to avoid really tackling the problem at source.
You are probably as fed up as I am with the long running feud between
farmers and badger groups, but I cannot let the recent spate of invective in
‘opinion’ and correspondence pass without comment. I wouldn’t mind so much
if it was accurate, but some of the letters to the press are so wide of the mark
that I wonder the Editor allows their publication. A recent letter asks why, if
141

2003
we were able to virtually eradicate bovine TB in the 1950s with badgers around
then, can we not deal with it now. I have to assume that the writer is not old
enough to remember how many badgers there were on farms in those days. They
were shy secretive animals, hardly ever seen, and were barely a tenth of today’s
numbers. They certainly did not present the same challenge to cattle. Another
letter suggests that we should reintroduce “another programme of strict test
and slaughter reactors”. What does that writer think we have been doing all
these years? And the suggestion that other mammals are equally likely to act
as reservoirs of infection is also ridiculous; only rats could pose a real threat
and we are already legally obliged to poison them.
In 1997, as Chairman of Devon NFU, I accompanied Elliot Morley, the
animal health Minister in the newly elected Labour Government, on a factfinding tour of the county to see the TB situation for himself. We visited a
number of farms where it was difficult find alternative sources of reinfection.
We also had meetings with groups of farmers in hotspot areas. I think Mr
Morley was surprised by the fact that none of the farmers was advocating the
wholesale slaughter of badgers, although even then, some were at their wits
end as to what else could be done. At the end of the day, as the Minister was
preparing to leave for his flight back to London, his final comment to me was
that, although he was going to have nightmares over the decision, he saw no
alternative to the slaughter of some badgers. The go-ahead to the proposed
Krebs Trials followed shortly after.
I am therefore not in the least surprised that the trials prove that badgers
are implicated in the incidence of bovine TB. Nor am I surprised that reactive
culling of badgers increases the incidence by 27%. I pointed out to Professor
Bourne at a meeting in Launceston at the start of the Krebs Trials, my concern
that killing badgers on the farm of a TB outbreak was unlikely to reduce the
incidence, since badger territory was rarely the same as farm boundaries - farms
are historically bounded by streams, badger territory by high ground. Killing
some badgers from different colonies in an area is a recipe for disaster. Before
jumping to conclusions, we urgently need the results to date of the proactive
trials versus the no slaughter areas. Time is not on our side.
Meanwhile, we have many too many very bold badgers on farms today. I
am happy to see them and I have no wish to slaughter a single one - except the
villain that broke into Bev’s henhouse last summer and took some laying hens
one night and a broody with chicks another. But I would like to be allowed to
dig out and back-fill badger setts where they are appearing in fields or ruining
perfectly good hedge banks. Ruth Murray, the prime instigator of the Bill to
Protect Badgers, advised me many years ago that this would not kill a single

Memories of Geese and Ducks

badger but would restrict their breeding to the woods that are their natural
habitat.

December 24th
Memories of Geese and Ducks
A peacock, lying on the veranda of our bungalow, the tail-feathers spread out
in multi-coloured splendour, is my earliest memory of Christmas. My father
was acting as a police commissioner, on secondment from the Indian Army,
in southern India, and it was one of the all too rare occasions when we were
together as a family at Christmas time. I clearly recall my ayah telling me
that my father had been out in the jungle early to shoot the peacock for our
Christmas dinner. I presume turkey was not available, but I don’t suppose it
tasted very different. I have very little recollection of the actual meal, although
I do remember we had quite a party.
Most of our Christmases, as my brother and I grew up, were spent in England, with grandparents before the war and uncles and aunts during the war.
Turkey was invariably the choice of bird. I think my maternal grandparents
provided the only exception, in the shape of a goose. I remember trying to help
my grandfather pluck the bird, as he recounted the times he had collected the
Christmas goose from Billingsgate Market on his way to catch a train home to
Sussex from his London office, in the 1890s. He was a Brighton solicitor, before
he retired, with a strong hankering to return to farming, like his family before
him. He was a great one for tales of the old days. While I struggled with the
goose-down, he told me how he used to choose a goose, which would be passed
to a couple of assistants to deal with, while he haggled over the price. Within
about four minutes, the bird would be clean plucked, paid for, and he would be
on his way to Victoria station. I didn’t believe him then, and having plucked
a few geese in my time, I don’t believe him now. But he was right about the
taste being infinitely better than turkey.
Probably my most memorable turkey Christmas was spent, as a teenager,
with my Uncle Arthur, who farmed near Horsham in Sussex. A few days before,
his bank managers and their wives came to lunch to collect their turkeys, the
rearing of which was one of the many enterprises on the farm. I say bank
managers in the plural - the older one was retired, but appeared to be a family
friend and godfather to one of my cousins. After a splendid lunch, my Aunt
Esme’s homemade Neapolitan ice cream for me has never been equalled, the
bank managers were given a shotgun each and taken on a tour of the farm.
Apart from walking off the meal, I think the idea was to combine business with
143

2003
pleasure, and look upon it as the annual inspection to review the overdraft.
Uncle Arthur kindly allowed me to accompany them, carrying a four-ten and
acting as a beater, with strict instructions to shoot last and point well away
from the godfathers.
We never saw a pheasant all afternoon, and in a desperate effort to give them
at least one shot, Uncle Arthur climbed a tree to stir up a grey squirrel’s drey.
In the ensuing excitement, I inadvertently let off my gun, blowing a large hole
in the ground a few feet in front of one of the godfathers. The squirrel escaped
without another shot being fired, and my uncle fell out of the tree. After that,
I was lucky to be allowed to sit in on the game of solo whist, which rounded
off the day. Uncle Arthur, together with his brother, Monty, a very skilful
player, demonstrated how to take bank managers to the cleaners, although I’ve
no doubt they looked on it as payment for the turkeys. In later years I often
reflected, as I went into the bank on bended knee, how much more civilised the
procedure for renewing an overdraft was in those days.
For me, Christmases settled into a more normal routine after marriage. For
the first twenty years, we always went to Jenny’s parents for Christmas day.
The milking and morning chores, the walk across the fields to the in-laws by 2
o’clock for dinner, followed by the Queen and a circus on television, back home
to do the evening milking, and back again for the presents round the Christmas
tree. My mother-in-law always produced at least three Muscovy ducks, with
sometimes a goose as well, depending on the number of family present. She had
reared the birds herself to her own exacting standards and, boy, could she cook
duck. My idea of the best tasting bird for Christmas dinner has never been in
any doubt since then, although other duck dinners never seem to quite come up
to hers.
This year, Jim and Bev are having the whole family, fifteen of us, for dinner
down at the farm, and yes, we are having Muscovy duck! Happy Christmas.

Time to Get Rid of Quotas
Christmas is over and, with it, the time for nostalgia. As pleasant as it is to
reminisce about the old days, I much prefer looking forward. What can we
expect for farming in 2004? I don’t believe in making New Year resolutions,
but I hope our political masters will at least resolve to finalise the details of
the CAP reforms as soon as possible. Surely even they must understand the
importance of giving us twelve months to plan how we are going to manage our
farms from 2005 onwards.
144

Dec 31st

Time to Get Rid of Quotas

Meanwhile here on this farm, we are going to have to go through the motions
for one more year of calculating how many cattle or sheep to apply for subsidy,
how many forage acres we can use for intensification, whether to sell steers
before or after taking headage payment and which permutation of these gives
us the best use of our various quotas. What a blessing it will be to get rid of
this totally useless system of support payments. Once it has gone, I have no
doubt that Jim will take a radically different view of the way he farms in the
future.
Will he keep beef cattle and sheep as the main enterprises, as we have done
for the last 15 years since we gave up dairy farming? He certainly won’t go
back into milk production – the investment needed would be prohibitive. Will
he keep all 300 acres down to grass as it now is, apart from about 30 acres on
my brother- in-law’s land, which is in an arable rotation? Will he plant more
trees – he has already planted 25 acres of mixed woodland in the last five years
to complement his timber enterprise? Or will he stop farming altogether and
leave the land idle, which is being suggested in some quarters as the sensible
option if there is no profit in producing food or fuel?
These decisions, which will have a far-reaching effect on future income, really
do need to be made well in advance. This coming year is the time to start making
the adjustments to the way the farm is run. We certainly don’t want a whole
lot of calves born in nine months time, if there is no intention to produce beef
in the years that follow. Continuing in lamb production is an easier decision to
make, with ewe subsidy on a lowland farm like ours relatively less important.
The land and climate here makes sheep farming one of the obvious choices if
we are to farm at world prices without support, so long as the competition
is genuinely fair. Planting trees is something the nation will have to make a
decision about; it is not an investment for the future that will ever be worthwhile
for the individual. Support of some sort, either in the form of tax breaks or
planting grants is essential if we want more decent woodland. We could, of
course, just let land go back to scrub, which would become woodland in due
course, and good natural woodland at that, but it will look pretty dreadful for
the first twenty years.
I don’t think Jim has made the final decision on whether to go organic, although we are so nearly organic already that I don’t expect the support changes
will have much bearing on that. But DEFRA really must announce what has
been decided within weeks rather than months, if it is not going to fail the
farming community once again. We need to know if we are going to be assessed
under an historic entitlement or whether regional averaging will be used. In our
case it will make little difference, as we farm very extensively, but it has the
145

2003
potential for considerable differences in the way farming develops and therefore
on the level of production of the various commodities in the future.
What has not yet been explained is the ‘cross compliance’ requirement that
will be imposed on us, if we wish to qualify for our acreage payments. Putting it
simply, what are we going to have to do to prove that we are actually continuing
to farm? I cannot believe that we shall merely have to mow our fields once a
year; that is a ridiculous suggestion that the public would not tolerate for very
long. The historic option does totally detach payment from farming, so that
a different form of compliance might be reasonable to one under an averaging
system. In the latter case some sort of agricultural production would need to
be undertaken to prove that it is farmland that is being subsidised. Or are
we going to pay people who own large chunks of parkland or even extensive
gardens, if they immediately claim that they have really been farming all these
years. Come on DEFRA, get your act together and tell us where we are going.

Horrified by Lack of Action
I was very pleased to see that David Hill has been awarded an MBE in the
New Years Honours list. As the Devon NFU Chairman through the ‘Foot and
Mouth’ year, his leadership of the farming community was quite exceptional.
The countless times he appeared on TV, standing in front of the barricade at
the end of his farm lane, and saying to camera words that exactly matched the
sentiments that we were all feeling, and the hours he and his wife, Susan, spent
on the phone sympathising with and supporting those of us who were in real
trouble are not really sufficiently rewarded with a ‘gong’ from the establishment.
I know there was a lot more to it than that, but I can’t think of any farmer
who could have represented us better than he did that year.
I am reminded of the occasion some years before when many of us went up
to London to a meeting in Westminster Hall to lobby our MPs, at the height
of the BSE crisis. David spoke for Devon on how seriously BSE was affecting
beef producers. He told the assembled farmers about the night he had gone out
with his wife to assist in calving one of his best cows. After bedding up the
cow and her newly born calf, he found himself remarking to Susan that, due to
the collapse in beef prices, the bale of straw they had used was probably worth
more than the calf. That summed up quite simply why we were all in London
that day.
I know ‘Foot and Mouth’ was a terrible episode for all of us, but the worst
of it could so easily have been avoided had the authorities been more vigilant.
They knew from past experience the sort of measures that needed to be taken.
BSE is quite another and far more serious disease, for which we were totally
unprepared. We still don’t know exactly how it originated, whether it is always
present in cattle in minuscule numbers, as I suspect, or whether it is a novel
147

2004
genetic mutation that occurred about 20 years ago. Whichever is now really
immaterial, although I suppose in time as testing methods improve, it should
be possible to eradicate BSE completely if it is solely genetic. The important
thing is that we have learned, with enormous heartache and expense how to deal
with it. We don’t know for certain the relationship between BSE and vCJD,
it is still only an assumption, but we have put in place exacting measures to
ensure that infective material cannot enter the human food chain. Thankfully
the statistics indicate that these have worked.
We also now understand that we must never allow ruminants to be fed meat
and bone meal. It is easy to say that we should never have allowed the practice
in the first place, but the overriding national desire to keep down the price
of meat and milk, following the drought affected US soybean harvests of the
1970s, which encouraged the excessive use of meat and bone meal in animal
rations, was most likely the real cause of the problem. Again thankfully, the
figures show that the disease is rapidly fading out of the national herd. We have
reached a point where testing of all cattle at slaughter can ensure that BSE will
become at worst no more serious than anthrax, and at best, eventually, almost
forgotten.
I was horrified, therefore, over Christmas, to read about the occurrence of
one BSE case in the United States. It was not the fact that a cow had gone
down with the disease; if I am right in thinking that it occurs very occasionally
in all cattle, that was to be expected. What horrified me was the statement
by US Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, outlining the steps that were being
taken to ensure the necessary precautions were in place. Where, for goodness
sake, has the US Department of Agriculture been for the last ten years? Have
they learnt nothing from our experience?
Apparently they are continuing to allow, even now, some mechanically recovered meat into the human food chain, a practice totally banned in the UK.
Downer cows, as they call them, are also continuing to be eaten without a full
testing regime in place. They have no system of national animal identification,
and only an approximation of the age of many of their cattle, a vital factor in
the infectivity of BSE as we have discovered. They think that the BSE case
was one of 82 cattle originally imported from Canada. 12 of these animals have
so far been traced, 70 are unaccounted for. And, if you can believe it, they are
continuing to allow the feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants. If I were
an American beef farmer, I would expect better than this. Precautions taken
long ago, in the light of British experience, would have ensured that one US
BSE case would have caused far less concern.

What Shall We Do With Big Cats

January 14th
What Shall We Do With Big Cats
Until last October I was not sure that I really believed big cats existed wild in
the countryside. There seemed to be plenty of reported sightings and evidence
of attacks on horses or sheep in the media, but I had never met anyone who
could say, hand on heart, that they had actually seen one. In a funny way I
think I preferred to leave it like that. Life becomes a bit flat if there are no
mysteries out there to solve. I am glad no one has yet found the Loch Ness
monster, or rather an explanation of all the sightings over the years. If they
ever do, Loch Ness will just become a very large rather boring pond.
So I must admit that I was perhaps a little disappointed to meet a fellow
farmer who was quite positive that he had seen a big cat. You may remember
that we had to put down our old Simmental stock bull last autumn. Jim had
noticed some very nice looking cattle when delivering wood to Tom Turner who
farms near Exeter. Tom and his wife Elizabeth breed Gelbviehs and Jim felt
that a young Gelbvieh bull, a breed new to us, would make a good immediate
replacement. I went with him to help choose one from a bunch of very impressive
yearlings and talking over a cup of tea afterwards, Tom remarked that he had
seen a big cat recently. What is more, he had seen it quite clearly in daylight
going into some brambles on neighbouring land; on investigating, he had flushed
it out the other side - it was large and brown with a dappling of paler spots.
A visiting German couple confirmed the sighting a day or two later. They saw
it crossing the farm track as they arrived and commented that they were not
aware that lynx still survive in the wild in England as they did in Germany.
Evidence like that is good enough for me. I can no longer scoff at blurred
photos of oversized moggies stalking mice along the edge of a distant field or
dismiss tales of badly mangled sheep as being just another case of dog worrying.
Even the NFU seems to have taken the matter seriously and asked us to report
sightings to the British Big Cats Society. So where do we go from here? Some
naturalists are anxious that we leave well alone, no doubt looking for another
addition to our native fauna, to join wild boar and the possible introduction of
wolves and beavers. Maybe if big cats prey on badgers, cattle farmers with TB
worries might not be concerned, but I doubt many sheep farmers would be too
happy with the idea. The real question becomes not whether big cats exist but
whether they are breeding successfully, which one has to assume, and if so, how
long before they become a real nuisance and how do we control their numbers.
I suppose a really snowy winter, like 1963, might give us a better idea of
how many there are out there – tracks in the snow are difficult to mistake.
149

2004
Meanwhile, sooner or later, someone is going to catch one attacking sheep and
attempt to shoot it. And a wounded puma wandering around a housing estate
is going to be pretty serious. Unlikely? Well, the big cat Tom Turner saw last
October was less than two miles from Exeter City centre.

January 21st
Waste of Time and Money
I am somewhat bemused by all that’s been said and written in the media on
the results of the GM crop field trials that were completed last autumn. I
thought the trials were supposed to give us a better understanding of the environmental consequences of growing GM crops here in the UK. As a farmer,
I am quite prepared to be guided by public opinion on whether we should use
GM technology for food production. As we all know, there are very conflicting
views on the subject, which I rather naively presumed the trials were set up to
help resolve. I could not have been more wrong - when the results were first
announced, both sides of the argument seemed to be claiming victory for their
point of view. Before bothering myself about the details, I thought it better to
wait until ACRE, the government’s advisory committee, had made its official
pronouncement. This came out last week, and can be accessed on the DEFRA
website. I have never read about such a waste of time and money in all my
years of farming.
To be truthful, I didn’t read all that was available regarding the trials – it
would take too long. What I did read makes it clear to any working farmer
that the trials had nothing whatsoever to do with GM crops – in the report’s
own words, they were “purely concerned with weed management”. There was
no evaluation of any direct effect of the actual GM crop on wildlife, or of any
yield or cost advantage in growing the crop in the first place. I begin to wonder
what GM technology had to do with the trials at all. All they proved was that
the more weeds you can kill in a crop, the fewer birds and butterflies you will
find in that field. Unless of course the birds and butterflies feed on the actual
crop itself, and as a farmer you don’t go out of your way to encourage that.
Unfortunately that is what farming is all about.
The three crops used for the trials were maize, beet and oilseed rape. I
have never grown rape, but have some experience of weed control in maize and
beet. When I started farming, the most boring and backbreaking job, which
had to be got through every year, was beet hoeing – in my case horse-hoeing
and singling mangolds. My root fields were the most environmentally friendly
in the neighbourhood, I never seemed to get on top of the job. Every root field
150

Stupidity of Burial Ban Rules

on other farms appeared immaculate – not a weed of any description to be seen.
And it was nothing to do with which spray was being used, there weren’t any,
it was straightforward manual work, as organic as you can get. How would that
look today by comparison in the GM trial result?
Maize growing then, as I witnessed on a University farm, was much the same;
being a crop that is very vulnerable to weed infestation, meticulous machine or
hand hoeing was essential. Nowadays sprays have taken over, and in the case
of maize almost too well, as the trials have shown.
It is sometimes forgotten that the man who probably did more to revolutionise farming was Jethro Tull. Not for him the scattering of the good seed on
the land. His invention of the seed drill in the early 18th century “allowing room
for diligent hoeing between the drills thereby removing weeds, those robbers of
plant-food” to use his own words, saw the beginning of the end of fields full of
poppies and all the other arable wild flowers, we are so worried about losing
now. Using a measure of weed infestation in a crop as a yardstick to decide on
the future of GM technology in farming is complete madness. Farmers will go
on looking for better ways to eliminate weeds for as long as we go on farming,
GM or not. Even organic farming uses flame-throwing machines to sterilise the
soil before planting, or cropping under polythene to keep weeds to a minimum.
If the Government uses these trials to decide on where we go from here, I
really do despair. Do what we like, GM technology is here to stay. What is
important is how we use and control it. For me, there was just one sentence
in the ACRE report that was relevant – “herbicide tolerant crops might allow
farmers to maximise the efficiency with which the land is farmed, leaving more
land to be managed for biodiversity”.

January 28th
Stupidity of Burial Ban Rules
With snowdrops and primroses already showing in the hedgerows, the bleating
of newborn lambs can now be heard on the farm. Whatever the weather throws
at us in the days ahead, I get the feeling that the New Year is now properly
gathering strength. For Bev, with two or three weeks of late nights and early
mornings, lambing her flock of 90 ewes, the absence of snow would be very
welcome. We have to make space in the cattle sheds for the ewes to come in
at night until they have lambed; heavy snow will mean the ewes with lambs
needing shelter as well, which only adds to the workload.
The last couple of years, Bev has had Leyland Branfield, from Dartmoor,
come and scan the flock to mark the ewes carrying twins or singles, and identify
151

2004
any that are not in lamb. Leyland has the job done in about an hour, which
saves many times that in the days ahead. The old shepherds of 100 years ago
would probably boast that they didn’t need newfangled technology to tell them
what they knew by instinct, but then they did live with their sheep day and
night all the year round.
Since the new laws about the non-burial of animals on the farm came in
last summer, we have been fortunate in losing only two sheep that had to be
disposed of. We were ‘good boys’ and had our local knacker come and fetch
them at £22 each, when they could have been safely buried in ten minutes
with our ditcher. However, with lambing about to start, I fully expected the
decision about carcass disposal to arise again and I phoned the knacker to see if
there was any service to collect stillborn or casualty lambs, without which it is
virtually impossible to get through lambing. It appears the cheapest way will
be to take any we get, by appointment, at a charge of 19p per kilo delivered.
As it happens, the first ewe to lamb produced stillborn twins. Bev would
probably not agree with me, but when Jenny was doing the lambing, after a
bad start lambing always seemed to go well and vice versa. Without tempting
fate, I don’t think Bev has lost any since then, but what are we supposed to
do meanwhile with two dead lambs. I doubt they weigh much more than a kilo
between them. The knacker-yard is about ten miles away as the crow flies, or 25
miles by road. The petrol used would probably be enough to safely incinerate
them at home without wasting time driving round the countryside. It’s a pity
we can’t give the job to the crows - a couple of them would make light work of
it without leaving the ground.
I’m intentionally making heavy weather of this to point up the stupidity
of bringing in these regulations before a proper carcass collection service was
up and running. I understand that a DEFRA-operated service has now been
agreed and will be starting at the end of February. In our case we will be asked
to pay our annual subscription just as we have finished lambing, which will
mean having to wait 12 months before being able to benefit for the one time in
the year when we are sure to need it. And the same will be true for many other
lowland sheep farmers.
I have no doubt most farmers lambing at present are quietly burying the
odd dead one as they always have done, unless they have very large flocks where
numbers might make it economic to get the knackers to collect. I suppose it
might be feasible to obtain an old freezer in working order from the local council
tip, and install it somewhere in the farm buildings to act as storage until lambing
is finished, or is that also illegal?

Sweet Water From the Spring

I have a pretty good idea where any of our lamb losses will end up this year.
We are laying about 500 yards of hedgerow just now, under our Stewardship
scheme, which involves some fairly hefty bonfires of the surplus growth – it is
about twenty years since these hedges were last laid in. The fires will be big
enough to dispose of an adult sheep, let alone a newborn lamb. I wouldn’t want
Jim or Bev to get into trouble through any indiscretion of mine, so if anyone
breaks the law, I’ll try and make sure it’s me.

February 4th
Sweet Water From the Spring
Suddenly it seems to be a case of water, water everywhere, but not where it
should be. And I am not only referring to the rain. Last week we discovered
that we had a leak in our main’s water supply. We have suspected for some
time that we were using more water than normal, but it has been gradually
getting worse – no drop in pressure, just a suspicion that the water bills were
increasing faster than the apparently inevitable rise in charges.
We were connected to the mains about 30 years ago, when there was government backing to get as many rural properties on mains water as possible.
The supply was brought down our lane to serve four farms, stopping at our
neighbour’s where our meter was installed. We were obliged to come the remaining mile to our farmhouse ourselves. Like the mains electricity, which we
had had connected a few years earlier, again with government support, it gave
us a whole new way of life. It is sometimes difficult to recall how we, and many
other farms in the wilds of Devon as it then was, managed in those far off days.
Before the 1950’s, many of the farmhouses had no piped water at all indoors
– an indoor water supply meant a ‘to and fro’ hand pump inside the backdoor connected by a lead pipe to a well. Around here, the wells were usually
spring-fed stone-lined chambers in an adjacent bank, and very sweet water they
produced. However as the number of available bucketfuls rather than gallons
was what mattered, quality was all. The introduction of Agas and Rayburns to
farmhouse kitchens, with back boilers to heat water, replacing the usual ‘range’,
changed all that. Our predecessor had installed an Aga, a bathroom and a tank
in the roof space a year before we bought the farm. The only slight problem was
that the water still had to be pumped by hand from the well. And at the height
of the summer, the supply still measured in bucketfuls – about five gallons a
day in a dry spell if we were lucky.
I suppose there are three instances that sum up those waterless years most
vividly for me. Nappies (no ‘disposables’ in those days), - the drudgery of nappy
153

2004
washing for Jenny often after she had hand-pumped water into the roof tank
if I was busy, and I was always busy. Washing up – visitors, down to stay in
the summer, helping by doing the washing up under a running tap, asking why
the water had stopped and their consternation when told that that’s all there
is until the tomorrow. And cattle drinking - watering the cattle with buckets in
the winter in their various stalls and pens. In the summer, they always drank
from the stream, and even when we first housed them in loose yards in the
winter, we had to allow them access across a field to the stream to drink.
When we bought the farm, locals told me that this was a ten-cow farm.
I discovered that they were referring not to the quality of the land, but the
availability of water from the stream in dry years, which governed the number
of cattle that could be reliably supplied. Sheep were a better option, since their
need for water was far less. The recent dry years have proved that point very
well. Last year the stream all but dried up, and as for ’76, without mains water
we would have been in a terrible situation with our milking herd of 80 cows; as
it was we only had the grazing to worry about.
Jim sorted out our leak without too much trouble. It was a case of putting
in stopcocks at intervals on our main pipe, which is about a mile and a half
with the field troughs, and isolating the stretch with the leak. A pity it was
not obvious last summer, when the ground was bone dry and the job would
have been simple. The South West Water’s leakage inspector, who was quite
unable to pin point the spot with his extended hearing aid, reckons the problem
is likely to recur anywhere in the system – it seems that the very small split we
found in the polythene pipe is due to normal ageing. We may be lucky and get
a leak allowance, but only this once. It looks like being a big expense to replace
the whole lot in the near future.
With global warming and rapidly rising water rates, plus a doubtful future
for beef production, should we view this once more as a ten-cow farm and revert
to well water for the house? Obviously not, but I expect Jim will consider
other options, such as boreholes, which a couple of farms near us rely on, and
reservoirs or ponds for the cattle, before digging up the whole farm again to get
through the next 30 years.

Well Done Fischler

February 11th
Well Done Fischler
I was very pleased to see, last week, that EU farm commissioner Franz Fischler
had entered the debate on how the new single farm payments should be made.
He has made it clear to the agriculture ministers of all the 15 EU member
states that they will have to justify any change from the original proposal of
the commission. Put simply, this was to base the payments on the production
subsidies received by individual farmers in past years, to compensate them for
the removal of these subsidies from 2005. It should be seen as a ‘redundancy
payment’ (my words) for our dismissal from the fruitless and often ridiculous job
of chasing subsidies, instead of producing for the market. Had it been possible
to pay us in one lump sum, instead of as declining instalments over the next
nine years, none of the interminable discussions of the last six months need have
taken place.
I have become increasingly fed up with the recent protests of the various
farmer-representative organisations that their members would be disadvantaged
if one hybrid system of payment was adopted instead of another. I thought,
perhaps naively, that we were getting rid of subsidies for good, not replacing
one outdated method of support for an alternative, which would itself become
obsolete within a matter of years. To start paying subsidies to those of us who
have never received them in the past in the name of fairness, as we phase them
out altogether, seems to be madness of a tall order.
It would be nice to think that by the end of the week all this will have
been resolved, but in view of Fischler’s intervention, I am not too hopeful. Our
political mistress, Margaret Beckett, will no doubt use it as an excuse to put off
the expected announcement and allow us to go on fighting among ourselves. I
believe the decision does not have to be made officially for another six months,
which would be extremely damaging for any of us who are hoping to start
making long terms plans for our individual farming businesses.
The question then becomes – do we think there is any long-term future to
start planning for? I doubt whether Beckett or any of her subordinates have
the least idea, even after reading all the policy documents that have crossed her
desk in recent years. It’s a pity Fischler isn’t an English politician; I’d swap
Beckett for him any day. Meanwhile all of us in farming are waiting to be told
the general direction we are expected to take for the next two or three decades
– that is the minimum time scale we need to consider, not the nine or ten years
currently under discussion.
I suppose, like any other farmer, I have my own particular view of what that
155

2004
direction should be. Not for me a countryside turned into one great UK National
Park. Nor do I have any hankering to return to the good old days, which never
actually existed except in the bucolic imagination of some commentators on
past rural life. The depression years between the wars are never very apparent
from the black and white photographs on which we base our memories.
My vision, which is no doubt shared by many farmers of my generation, is
very different. It is one where we continue to improve crop yields and livestock
production as dramatically as we have in the past 50 years, using all the tools
that science can offer, including, I am coming to believe, GM technology. I think
that would give us much the best chance of improving the environment, while
maintaining a profitable farmed countryside, without subsidies. Just reducing
production or farming more extensively doesn’t necessarily do anything for wild
life. If we want more birds and butterflies, we have to actually do something
to encourage them. I suppose I am really saying that we should be actively
farming the environment as well as producing food. We seem to be tiptoeing in
that direction, but current stewardship and level-entry schemes are only playing
about at the fringes.
So my hope is that when the decision on the ‘single farm payment’ is announced, we start thinking seriously about how we use the money that will be
available as those payments decline. As a nation we are remarkably rich in
wildlife expertise in the shape of the Attenboroughs and Bellamys of this world.
It shouldn’t be too difficult to harness farming actively to the environment if
we put people of that calibre at the helm.

February 18th
Pulling Power of Runaway
I’ve no doubt you are as heartily sick of the subject of CAP reform as I am, so
today I shall write about something entirely different. You may remember a few
weeks back a report of some wild boar escaping from a farm in Dorset. I believe
a few were recaptured and one was shot, but I never heard what happened to
the remainder.
It reminded me of an incident during my first year here. I started farming
in partnership with John Thurley, a fellow graduate from my university days,
and his wife Nancy. Among the live and dead stock we inherited from the
outgoing farmer were two very large breeding pigs. One was a Saddleback
called Empress, who proved to be a good mother with large litters and a fairly
happy disposition. The other was a Large Black with a fearsome temper and
very poor mothering qualities, called Black Maria. We realised that she was in
156

Feb 18th

Pulling Power of Runaway

fact severely handicapped; her large floppy ears, a characteristic of the breed,
had by covering her eyes over the years, left her nearly blind. Her hearing was
acute and she would stand with her head on one side listening for your approach
at feeding time, but driving her from place to place was not easy.
Between litters, we let the two sows run in the orchard, but owing to their
size, pig netting proved somewhat ineffective. Electric fencing was becoming
all the rage at the time, and we thought an electrified wire round the orchard
might do the trick. Having set it up, we watched to see what the sows would
make of it. Empress soon found out that the pig netting had acquired a bite,
and steered well clear, but Black Maria took a long time before she blundered
into it accidentally. The result was not what we’d intended. With a ferocious
squeal, she turned and bolted across the orchard, through the electric fence
and pig wire the other side, as if they didn’t exist, and disappeared into the
distance.
We searched for her ineffectually for two days, until neighbours reported
seeing a large black animal at the top of one of our furthest fields. John, Nancy
and I, reckoning it would take all three of us to drive her home, set off with some
relief at knowing where she was. However, it didn’t turn out as we expected. For
a start, Black Maria was in a steep eleven-acre field, which had been neglected
for many years and, being mid-summer, was at the time completely covered
in chest high bracken - try finding a blind pig with acute hearing in that. All
we could see from the top of the field was the bracken swaying as Black Maria
moved.
John suggested that he should drive her to the top while we shouted directions as to her whereabouts. Since he had represented the college at crosscountry running and was a personal friend of Chris Brasher, we readily fell in
with the suggestion, but to no avail. Black Maria had no intention of coming
quietly. Eventually, in desperation, John tackled her by grabbing one back leg.
One minute he was visible, head and shoulders moving purposefully, and the
next he had disappeared with a cry of “I’ve got her” and leaving a swathe of
movement through the bracken as he was dragged along at some speed on his
stomach.
I rushed down to help and after a considerable chase managed to grab her
other leg. I was much heavier than John, and assuming I could hold her, to get
his breath back he let go. It wasn’t an unpleasant sensation. The ground under
the bracken was very soft, and Black Maria on three legs had no difficulty towing
my 14 stone back and forth around the eleven acres. I remember wondering how
long I could hang on, realising that we would probably never see the pig again if
I let go. After dispatching Nancy back to the farm to fetch the Fergie, link box,
157

2004
and a length of rope, John caught up with me and grasping one back leg each,
we lay there holding firm for half an hour, discussing how we would reclaim the
field to pasture and what we would do with Black Maria, if we could get her
home.
Black Maria was never quite the same again - I think the spirit rather went
out of her after that. The field, however, did make good pasture. Facing north,
with a deep loamy soil under the bracken, it has proved valuable grazing in dry
summers.

February 25th
Lambing Nearly Over
I never fail to be amazed by the antics of very young lambs. It’s a beautiful
clear sunny morning with a slight frost first thing, and we are into the last week
of February. Lambing is nearly over for this year - Bev has only about a dozen
ewes left to go – and the flock is in the field outside my office window. Thirty or
forty lambs, hardly three weeks old, are playing tag near our garden fence. They
stand in a large group until one decides to set off at a bouncing canter along the
fence for about thirty yards, with the rest in hot pursuit. After regrouping, they
stand for thirty seconds and another lamb decides to be ‘it’ and sets off back
again the thirty yards and the process is repeated six or seven times. I presume
it is instinctive flock behaviour from the days before sheep were domesticated;
perhaps they are deciding which would one day make a good leader but to me
it looks like the joys of spring are here again.
This year, there is an extra joy – it is the last time Bev will have to fill out
the sheep subsidy form. She won’t have to worry about how many ewes we
have quota for, or whether we will be penalised for dropping below the number
we must keep through the three-month retention period. Next year by this
time all the production subsidy claim forms will be history. If lamb prices this
summer are poor, Bev can cut back ewe numbers or, if she wants, give up sheep
altogether. Conversely, if lambs do really well, she can double the flock without
bothering about how many cattle we have on the farm. I doubt if people outside
farming ever really understood how such details of sheep numbers dictated the
amount of subsidy we could claim on our cattle. Hopefully the new farm support
payments will be more transparent to the general public; we certainly need to
make sure they are and that they give good value for money.
I haven’t bothered to calculate yet how the new payment system will affect
us personally. There are still far too many unknowns to be decided, but I guess
we may be slightly better off than we would have been under a purely historic
158

Feb 25th

Lambing Nearly Over

assessment. That doesn’t alter my opinion that compared with the other three
regions of the UK, England has ended up with a pigs ear of a botch up in the
initial years of the scheme. How DEFRA is ever going to get things up and
running - computer programmes, complaints procedures, tribunals, and so on
– by the time the first payments are due in 2006 I cannot conceive. I am just
thankful that we are owner-occupiers and not tenant farmers, who look like
being the real losers.
Much has been made in the press about the likelihood of some farmers not
bothering to actually produce anything at all in future. I heard an MP pointing
out in the brief debate in the Commons when the scheme was introduced, that
someone like the Duke of Westminster would be making ‘x’ millions a year
without getting out of bed in the mornings. There is talk of just having to
mow the fields once a year, and maintain the hedges, in order to comply with
the requirement of keeping the land in good agricultural condition. This has
yet to be agreed in detail, but I am worried that if we are not careful, crosscompliance, as this is called, may end up being far more burdensome than we
are anticipating. It would be a real disaster if we went from counting how many
animals we had on the farm every day of the year, to counting how many furze
bushes or noxious weeds we had allowed to invade our fields.
It is also a problem that could cut both ways. Although some farmers may
do as little as possible to qualify for their acreage payments, it could be that
on other farms quite the reverse will happen. Cross-compliance is bound to
have an upper as well as a lower threshold. I can visualise that new entrants
to the industry, paying hefty rents and wanting to expand production, perhaps
because older farmers have cut back too far and allowed shortages to occur,
may be severly restricted because of unduly harsh environmental constraints.
We could end up with some farms trying to produce too much, while others are
trying to do too little. To some extent the present system of subsidies, governed
by quotas on livestock or eligible fields for crops, has evened out that anomaly.
The look of our countryside may yet change in some quite unexpected ways.

Problems of the “Good Life”
There was a headline in the farming press recently saying that more and more
farmers are turning to diversification. Figures in the new Farm Business Survey
show that over 6,200 South West farmers have now diversified into non-food
businesses. Perhaps I am old fashioned, but I find that to be a very sad state
of affairs. Our region is fast becoming one of part-time farmers.
I am described at the foot of this column as ‘helping on a family farm’. Until
the other day, I have never really bothered to analyse exactly what is meant
by that expression. I was attending a meeting of the Devon Farm Management Association, where Professor Michael Winter, of Exeter University, was
speaking on ‘Family Farming: Past, present and future’. He made the point
that historically all the work on a farm has rarely been carried out solely by
family labour, which the term ‘family farm’ implies. There were nearly always
at least one or two employed workers on any farm larger than a smallholding.
Today, our rather fanciful view of the South West as an area best served for its
landscape and environmental values by traditional small family farms, handed
down from one generation to the next, is not factually correct.
In my opinion, the idea of farming being some kind of television ‘good life’
is actually proving very detrimental to the future of the industry. Farming
has never been like that – often in the past, farming has been a tough, harsh,
uneconomic slog. For some families it has certainly proved to be a very bad life,
from which it has been difficult to escape. Unfortunately, there are some farmers
around who seem to be keen to perpetuate this myth of an idyllic lifestyle which
farming should aspire to. I have even heard impassioned speeches at farmer
meetings demanding that smaller farms be given some sort of preferential price
support or subsidy payments, to ensure their survival. Apart from the fact that
those small farms tend to have smaller fields, and therefore a larger proportion
of hedgerow wildlife, which looks like being paid for directly in the future, I have
only ever heard one satisfactory explanation for the benefit of their preservation.
They do provide the opportunity for new entrants to get a start in the industry.
I became a farmer because it was a profession I wanted to join. But if you
had told me that by the time I reached the end of my career, farming in Devon
would have to depend on diversification for survival, I would have told you to
take a running jump. I see being a farmer as a full time job, not a very well paid
one its true, but one that requires a fair amount of dedication to be successful.
And success, through one’s lifetime, implies specialisation, intensification or
expansion.
160

Mar 10th

Meetings Have Changed

I see ‘diversification’, therefore, as a very dirty word. In saying that, I should
make it clear that I find it unfortunate the word is so often misused. I think
diversification should only mean branching out into an activity not related to
raising crops or animals on a farm. Obviously anything to do with tourism,
recreation or sport would qualify. But I don’t consider farmers markets, farm
shops or farmhouse speciality food production as other than a normal extension
of farming. It is only in the last 50 years that we have developed the habit of
producing one or two basic products on the farm, dumping them at the farm
gate for some one else to deal with, and then moaning if the price we receive
is not all we anticipate. Before that time, farming involved making a living
by selling everything we produced to the best advantage. And that included
timber as fuel, building material or wood for furniture production.
Which brings me neatly to the ‘diversification’ as many would call it, or
‘natural extension’ as I prefer to see it, that Jim has developed in recent years
on this farm. Undoubtedly the timber enterprise he has built up has made
a big difference to our finances. But is this really anything new? There has
always been at least 50 acres of woodland here, which must have produced some
income in the past. There is clear evidence of coppicing, charcoal burning and
fuel production and, no doubt, a good few beams now in local houses and barns
must have started life here. This is not diversification; it is making the most of
what we already have.

March 10th
Meetings Have Changed
We had our first NFU meeting last week to hear how the new single payments
scheme will work down on the farm. Jim should have been the one to go, since
he will be making the decisions that will be affected, but it was his night for
his weekly French lessons, so I was dispatched instead. I am sure the French
lessons have no bearing on the Pettyfer family’s farming future, if that’s what
you are thinking, but you never know.
I arrived before the meeting was due to start, to find that all the available
seats were occupied; farmers were already sitting on the floor at the front and
I ended up squeezed in among the throng filling the back of the room and out
through the doorway. I should think there were nearly 400 farmers present.
After standing for two hours, it did cross my mind that I had possibly attended
more Devon NFU meetings than any other farmer alive. In the old days, a
meeting this important would probably have taken place at the old Rougemont
Hotel in Exeter, but today the number of farmers likely to be at a meeting is
161

2004
very difficult to estimate. A local branch AGM to elect office holders can almost
be held in a broom cupboard, while a shift in Government farm policy seems
to draw farmers from all over the county.
In the event we learnt very little, except that for many of us, our worst fears
were justified. The simple new farm support payments are likely to be more
complicated than ever. I had hoped we were entering a brave new world, but it
looks as if some farmers, as in the past, are going to be more equal than others.
That is unless some pretty substantial changes are made, but I am horribly
afraid it may already be too late.
For one thing, having Scotland and Wales working to an entirely different set
of rules from England is totally impractical. Northern Ireland can go their own
way, without causing too much bother, but on the mainland we use abattoirs,
livestock markets and dairy processors regardless of regional boundaries. I know
the new payments are intended to be completely decoupled from production,
but in practice it is not that easy. Surviving financially in difficult years may
well depend on how much single payment an individual farm has to fall back
on. If the proposal for England is so much better, as Margaret Beckett insists,
she should, as the Minister responsible nationally, have ensured that at the very
least the three regions all end up by 2012 doing the same thing.
For another, it is a total mystery to me how anyone in DEFRA, advising
ministers on which land should be paid less per acre than the norm, lumped
enclosed farmland with open moorland. If we are to be paid for keeping land in
good agricultural condition, as stated, it is surely no easier to do so in or near
national parks than anywhere else. That particular decision must be changed
and quickly.
It was a pity there was no one present that evening from DEFRA, not to
take any active part in the meeting, but to hear at first hand from the questions
raised the views of grassroots farmers. This used to happen in the past, by
invitation, before DEFRA officialdom moved to Bristol, leaving us down here
with just a payments agency. Had any ministry officials been there, they would
have been struck, as I was, by how anxious farmers are that this new system of
farm support should succeed. We want to ensure it gives the public value for
money, is as fair as possible and stands the test of time. We have had enough
of the slurs of being feather bedded, receiving cash handouts or being paid for
doing nothing. And unfortunately, as things stand, being paid for doing nothing
is still very much a possibility.
The meeting was overwhelming in its determination to see that no one ends
up being paid just for owning farmland. That is something the public would not
tolerate. Getting a contractor to run a mowing machine over the land once a
162

Mar 17th

Lucky Not to Commute

year, and trotting down to the bank with an annual cheque, is a worse scenario
than the one we are currently getting rid of. It might look all right to officials
in Whitehall, but to any decent farmer it would be an anathema. I think we
should either produce something useful or, failing that, let the county trusts for
nature conservation or societies like the RSPB dictate how the land should be
managed.

March 17th
Lucky Not to Commute
With last week’s terrorist bombing of the Spanish commuter trains still echoing
through the daily news, it seems frivolous to be writing about the everyday
happenings here on the farm. How lucky most of us are that we have only
to walk outside of a morning and our day’s work is right there. The thought
of having to travel, packed like sardines in stuffy carriages, wasting hours of
each day just to work in some city office has always made me glad I chose a
farming life. Some years ago, when I was closely involved in the day to day
running of a dairy farmer cooperative, I used to travel by train every week to
our office in Buckinghamshire, which involved crossing London in the rush hour.
It didn’t take many months of struggling by underground to persuade me to
walk between the main line stations. Not only was it far pleasanter, especially
through the London parks, it was often much quicker. And in future, by all
accounts, it will probably be much safer.
Hedge laying for this year has now been completed. I don’t know that the
sap has started rising, which used to be the signal to stop. In the past, the
spring work generally took over, but this year spring doesn’t seem able to make
up its mind whether it’s here or not. One day the temperature is well below
freezing, the next it is up around 17 degrees; it looks like being a late start to
the growing season.
Since we joined the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, laying hedges is not
quite the haphazard job it used to be. We used to lay them in no particular
order, but allowed them to grow until the sheep started pushing through the
gaps that inevitably developed with increasing height. A couple of strands of
barbed wire kept the cows in, but we would never have dreamt of wasting money
on sheep netting as well. All that has changed. To start with, we were obliged
to leave our hedges for about five years untouched, to have enough that needed
attention to even qualify to join Stewardship. We now have a 10-year plan in
which, among other things, the hedges are destined to be cut and laid in strict
sequence.
163

2004
This means that, to keep to our schedule, approximately 1000 meters of
hedgerow has to be tackled every winter what ever else needs doing. Added to
that, each hedge has to be protected on both sides with sheep netting and high
tensile barbed wire to precise “stewardship” specifications. From an agricultural point of view, the need for a hedge seems to have largely disappeared. I
have a suspicion that by taking a heavy hedge-cutting circular saw down every
hedgerow and removing all the growth to ground or bank level, putting up two
concentration-camp like fences six meters apart, and leaving the whole lot to
grow for fifteen years, the result would not only look exactly the same, but
might even be better for wildlife. Certainly the skill in being able to lay a stock
proof hedge is no longer necessary.
Having done all that, the subsequent hedge-trimming regime is also strictly
regulated – only twice every five years, with no encouragement to let the hedge
grow up again. That is a total nonsense – the need for hedge-trimming changes
with the stages of growth after laying, and the shrubs and trees involved, which
vary considerably in different parts of the country, and even from place to place
in Devon and Cornwall. I am not happy with the idea of inflicting a kind
of uniformity on our landscape, in an attempt to pay farmers for what used
to be done of necessity. Perhaps I am being a little harsh in my criticism of
the current stewardship regulations; we have been able to alter our schedule,
provided we have applied in writing at set times on the proper forms. I also
get the feeling that the new Environmental Stewardship Scheme that will be
available from next year, is going to be far more imaginative and less prescriptive
in its approach.
We need a scheme to draw on from year to year, according to our individual
farms, and not one that sets out a ten year plan on enough paper to fill a
box file. Why am I optimistic? Well, we received a letter a week or two ago
telling us that the rates of payment for the various stewardship jobs had been
substantially increased. For example, the rate for hedge laying has gone up by
66%, and not before time. Not only that, but the increase is being backdated
and will include all the work we have done this last winter. Wonders will never
cease.

Old Ties to Down St. Mary

March 24th
Old Ties to Down St. Mary
Today happens to be a strange anniversary for our farm. On March 24th
1884, exactly 120 years ago, this farm was transferred by Local Government
Board Order from Down St. Mary parish to the parish of Woolfardisworthy.
I discovered this interesting little historical detail quite recently in the Kelly’s
Directory of 1930, while researching the previous occupants that had farmed
here. A friend, with computer access to the old census details, could find no
one living here in the late 19th century until I asked him to check the Down
St. Mary records. Sure enough, the farm appears there in the 1881 census,
with the name of the farmer, Richard Hern, a 33-year-old bachelor, living here
with a housekeeper and employing one man and a boy. The Internet is a great
invention if you want to find obscure facts about the past without leaving the
comfort of your own home.
What I don’t know is why the farm changed parish on that particular date,
the day before Lady Day. I can hazard a guess, but I can see I shall have to
do a lot more research. Down St. Mary and Woolfardisworthy are not adjacent
parishes – Morchard Bishop comes between them, so it is not a case of redrawing
parish boundaries. The farm was certainly farmed by Richard Hern, the family
were here as tenants until the 1930s and I knew his son, who told me a lot
about the farm. The tenancy of the farm certainly did not change hands in
1884, which would be one reason for a change of parish. Nor did it change
ownership in that year.
I have a beautifully drawn map, which my daughter, Cath, made as a teenager when doing a school project into tithe records. It shows the owners, tenants, field names, acreages and crops grown for the all area we farm. It is dated
1842 and is taken from the tithe rent map for Down St. Mary, which makes an
obvious connection, but it gives the landlord of this farm as the same Morchard
Bishop family that owned many of the tenanted farms round about, and who
were still living at their home farm when I first came. In fact I had a problem at
the time, as this was one of the last farms to be sold from the estate and there
were no title deeds. I had to get an affidavit from the two surviving spinster
sisters that they were the true owners. They are, of course, long gone, and I
have been here long enough now to assume I would have no difficulty claiming
squatter’s rights.
However, ‘tithe’ would seem to be the connection to Down St. Mary. The
tithe redemption payments that I was saddled with in those early years were
certainly made to that parish, which I never quite understood. Except that, as
165

2004
the new owner, I was also stuck with something called a ‘chief rent’ of seven
shillings and sixpence a year to the Crichel Down Estate in Wiltshire. Older
readers may remember questions being raised in Parliament over Crichel Down
land, which had been requisitioned in the war and was being sold off without
reference to the original owners. I couldn’t find out what ‘chief rent’ referred
to or the connection to Crichel Down, although I received repeated demands
for payment. After some years, the agent for the estate arrived to persuade
me to cough up, saying that the family were anxious to keep up these old
traditions, but he was also unable to tell me what it was for, beyond the fact
that the estate had once owned land in Down St. Mary. I never did pay and I
sometimes wonder what rights in Down St. Mary I might now have, had I done
so.
Looking back, I wish I had asked more questions of people locally. In the
1950s, older people often told me of their experiences assuming quite rightly
that, as a newcomer, I would be interested. I remember a retired police superintendent, who worked part time in the office of the Mill in Copplestone, where I
used to buy all my animal feed and fertilizers, telling me of his early days in the
police force. Apparently, on one occasion as a young copper, he found himself
standing in trepidation with drawn truncheon on the road between Down St.
Mary and Copplestone, facing a large mob of farmers armed with pitchforks,
who were on their way to thwart the bailiffs during the tithe wars of the early
1930s. At the last minute, the farmers dived over the hedge on each side of the
road, to reappear some way behind him, marching on to help the farmer, who
was holding out against the tithe. Sounds like the old age pensioners and the
Council Tax today.

Stitch-up for Hill Farmers
I make no excuses for returning to the subject of the ‘Single Farm Payment’.
Last week saw another twist in the convoluted process of turning a simple idea
into a workable scheme of farm support for the next eight years. Franz Fischler,
the EU farm commissioner, had proposed getting rid of agricultural subsidies
by paying farmers at whatever rate per acre each of them had been receiving in
the recent past, with complete freedom to produce as much or as little as they
wished, provided they continued to manage the land as farmland. Over the
coming years the amount each farmer received would fall, with environmental
schemes introduced to look after the countryside in a manner to which the
166

Mar 31st

Stitch-up for Hill Farmers

public had become accustomed. Most of us, being heartily sick of the old ways,
cheered quietly as we went about our daily chores.
That was over a year ago. I read through the original EU proposals the
other day to see if I had remembered them correctly. If we were farming in
Scotland or Wales now, that is how we would be looking at the future, and I
haven’t heard of any dissent about it from farmers in those regions. But here
in England things are very different. With only nine months to go before the
new scheme begins, we are still negotiating the basic principles with DEFRA.
Margaret Beckett, in her wisdom, decided that individual historic entitlements
were unfair and should be phased out as soon as possible. Farmers should share
and share alike, even though some had never had any subsidy payments in the
past.
As you would expect, that certainly stirred farmers up. A scheme that
was probably unfair but straightforward, is now just as unfair but complicated.
The latest row over the Minister’s decision to put upland enclosed farmland
with open moorland, as a separate category from the rest of us, seems to have
brought things to a head. I suppose her reply to these farmers had she bothered
to meet them would have been “You were in a severely disadvantaged area –
you are still in severely disadvantaged area”.
At the time of writing, I don’t know if this has now all been settled by the
united request from the farming organisations. If it has, it will still result in the
upland farmers of England eventually receiving little more than half that of their
lowland compatriots, or similar upland farmers in Wales and Scotland. The
obvious proposal from the National Beef Association of averaging all farmers
up to the moorland line did not prevail; it had to concede to the NFU and others
to reach the consensus Mrs Beckett demanded. I know there were reasons why
a moorland line was felt to be unobtainable, but it comes into the suggested
new formula, which rather begs the question. I am left with the conclusion that
the hill farmers have been stitched up. I know some lowland farmers feel that
the hills were sometimes unduly favoured in the past, but I just hope this didn’t
influence the attempt to get the fairest outcome.
This whole episode has thrown up a number of questions, which I assume
will have to be answered very soon - why should unproductive moorland have an
acreage payment at all, how do you maintain it in good agricultural condition
and, as an afterthought, how much would the enclosed uplands benefit if most
moorland fails to qualify? Or perhaps grouse shooting is an agricultural pursuit?
Going on from there, when is an orchard not an orchard? Orchards, which
don’t qualify, have been allowed as forage acres when applying for cattle and
sheep subsidies. In fact we have been ordered to call grazed woodland ‘orchard’
167

2004
on our IACS forms. We are encouraged to allow the odd tree to remain in
the middle of pasture land. How many apple trees are odd? Which brings
me on to woodland itself. Moorland is OK for Single Farm Payments, but not
woodland according to Mrs Beckett. If we are to continue to encourage new
tree planting in England, that anomaly will have to be corrected. I believe
that in the newly joining EU countries like Poland, every acre will qualify,
including private gardens. Since many of the farms there are not much bigger
than gardens, I suppose that is not surprising. But what about the many
private gardens here, which include small meadows that are being managed for
wild flowers by people who are not registered as farmers? Are they any less
entitled to an acreage payment?
More importantly, who has said this is all going to continue after 2012? I
know I am being frivolous and there are days when I am very optimistic about
the future, but this is not one of them.

Happier When I Disagree
I had a day out last Friday and went to an NFU arable conference at St Mellion
in Cornwall. We are not an arable farm ourselves, growing only enough corn for
our own use, but I am always interested to hear how the arable boys are doing
and it was a lovely day for the 50 mile drive through the Devon countryside.
Also, I can never resist the chance to hear the latest from my favourite agrieconomist, Sean Rickard. It’s not that I learn much to my advantage from his
pearls of wisdom, quite the reverse in fact - I am always happier when I disagree
with him.
I first remember him as the senior agricultural economist on the London
staff of the NFU. His advice to those of us who were up against it in those days
could be roughly translated as ‘get bigger or get out’. He quickly earned the
reputation among the smaller farmer members of the NFU as the economist we
loved to hate. I have no doubt he was probably right in theory, but we found in
our own case that in trying to follow his advice too quickly, our bank overdraft
seemed to get bigger faster than the acreage of our farm. We ended up at one
stage in what in banking terms is called negative equity, a very nasty financial
hole to find oneself in, although I admit I teetered on the edge of it all my early
years.
It did teach me one valuable lesson, however. Our then bank manager,
a young go-getter who I believe subsequently did well in his career, strongly
advised us to get out of farming while we could, since in his opinion, interest
168

rates which were then at an all time high, would never return to single figures
in his life time. I have concluded that economic experts are probably right in
their predictions, but perhaps fail to realize that the more people take their
advice, the more likely the opposite will happen.
To return to Sean Rickard, I am glad to say that once again I was not
disappointed. I enjoyed what he said but was not convinced by his conclusions.
The Government will abandon farming in favour of the environment, therefore
marketing is more important than ever before. I could argue that subsidies may
well have encouraged overproduction and a lack of market demand; shortages
may do more for us than all our efforts in marketing ever will.
We should see collaborating within the food chain as a form of marriage
contract. I doubt if the younger generation in agriculture will be too enthusiastic
with that. It will be even less enthusiastic with Sean Rickard’s other idea that
to achieve economies of scale, we should collaborate with our neighbours, put
our farms together and employ a professional manager to take full control. We
could then become farm workers on our own farms. Utopia at last – I drove
home a happy man.

April 14th
Stupidity of Stewardship Regulations
The cattle are going out to grass at last. The main herd of cows and calves
went out last week, and the store cattle, except those we are intending to sell,
should be out of the buildings by the end of this week. It will be a pleasure to
see the back of the daily chore of strawing out and feeding, which divides the
farm year into two distinct halves. The summer routine involving a daily walk
round the different groups of cattle, which Jim can easily leave to Jenny or me,
I find as I get older, is the most enjoyable part of farming.
About 30 dry cows have remained out all winter, and these are starting
to calve. Some of these cows, if they continue their present calving pattern,
will hardly spend any of their lives in a building at all. They also seem to
do better through the succeeding summer, presumably by avoiding the turnout
check experienced by the housed cattle. Perhaps in the future with the changes
to farm support, and the changing weather conditions, Jim may reduce the
number of breeding cows even more than he already has, and keep them all out
through the winter. It would certainly reduce the winter work and the need
to buy in straw for bedding. The buildings would only be needed for lambing,
emergency cattle housing or storage.
169

2004
It certainly sounds like a sensible way to go, one that would be welcomed
by the animal welfare and environmentally conscious public. There is difficulty,
however, with the stewardship rules, under which we are increasingly forced to
farm. We already have 50 acres, which we must keep free of all cattle and sheep
during the winter months, if we are to promote them as wildflower meadows.
Stewardship looks like becoming an even more important element in managing
the land, and inevitably we will end up with more constraints about stocking
levels with the new single farm payments. Do the people who make these rules
know what they are talking about, when they decide whether land is being
poached or over grazed? Whether the damage is temporary, and will recover
quickly, or is likely to do long term damage to the soil structure and should be
avoided?
We were hauled over the coals at our last Stewardship check visit for having mineral buckets in our lowland pasture – there must be no supplementary
feeding of any description, which apparently includes minerals. I see no logic in
this. We are obliged to graze cattle or sheep in these fields for at least two and
a half months each summer. But we know that on our ground it is essential
to supply mineral licks or end up with sick animals. So what are we supposed
to do? The cattle can trample the ground approaching the water trough – we
are not encouraged to let them drink in the stream – but they mustn’t trample
the ground around a mineral lick, even if we move it daily. How stupid can you
get?

Our Barn Owls Are Back
We are hoping we have barn owls nesting again in the old stone barn adjoining
us. They have reared young there for many years in the past, before we built
our house on the site of an old shippon. We were afraid they might be disturbed
when the building was going on, but they carried on regardless, and for the first
two years after we moved in, we had the pleasure of watching them from our
sitting room window. Fledging barn owls, learning to fly and peering in at us
from the pergola, were a real pleasure. Then two years ago, they seemed to have
to have deserted us. We occasionally saw a single bird and assumed its mate
must have died. There are plenty of barn owls around in this area of Devon,
and in the last week we have seen two flying in and out of the barn at dusk.
We are also greeted with much hissing as we pass, so with luck we are back to
a breeding pair.
170

Our Barn Owls Are Back

The other bird that appears to be in decline on the farm is the song thrush.
We have always had a few pairs nesting, but in some years the only evidence is
broken eggshell lying on a path or farm track. We rarely see them, except in
the early spring when they are feeding on ivy berries. I have always assumed
they were birds of woodland fringe, rather than open farmland, and never very
numerous anyway. I was interested therefore to read the latest theories of the
RSPB on the reasons for their decline.
As usual, we farmers are the culprits. Apparently, in the 1960s and 1970s,
we were encouraged to drain our land to grow more food, which we did so successfully that we dried out our soils. This resulted in a reduction in earthworms
for the birds to feed on. Come on RSPB, pull the other one. If the experts who
did this research and came to this conclusion studied their agricultural history,
they will see that all the real drainage work on farmland was undertaken over
100 years before. Not only were clay pipes introduced then, there were also
Government subsidies to encourage field drainage on an extensive scale. It is
estimated that over 4.5 million acres were drained during those ‘Golden Years’
of English farming.
I’d be surprised if virtually every acre of farmland in Devon was not drained
at that time, including our culm grassland, which I suspect was all ploughed up
and growing wheat for the few years that wheat prices were at their highest. It
is true that when I started farming here in 1950, we had a lot of very wet ground
- in places too wet to drive a tractor through and a serious problem with fluke
infestation. There were also a number of boggy spots in the middle of apparently
otherwise dry fields. Over the years, we have tackled all these areas, as the
RSPBs research quite rightly suggests. But in every single instance, we have
found that someone has got there before us. Our wettest field, about 5 acres
in extent, covered in rushes and bog plants of every description, the only field
were I could regularly find snipe, had a perfectly laid out herringbone drainage
system. We abandoned the idea of laying new pipes, and instead merely cleared
the junctions between the two-inch laterals and the three-inch mains. It seems
in 1850, when the land drains were laid, there were no ‘Y’ or ‘T’ pipes, and
the system had become blocked at these points. The junctions were so exactly
distanced apart, that we only had to measure on the surface and dig directly
down to find all of them. After laying new junction pipes, the field drained
itself, like pulling a plug out of a bath.
In every other case, we found similar examples of old but still serviceable
drains, which only needed attention, generally at the outfalls to the streams.
All this was done many years ago and put the farm back to the condition it had
been in 100 years before. It certainly did not appear to have any impact on song
171

2004
thrush numbers then. It is only in the last few years that we have noticed they
seem to be disappearing. If it is a lack of earthworms, why are not blackbirds
and missel thrushes, of which we have plenty, suffering the same fate? The
only theory I can suggest is predation of eggs by grey squirrels, a more recent
arrival. Song thrushes seem to be the earliest of the thrushes to nest, starting
long before the hedgerows come into leaf, and are thus more vulnerable.
As for following the RSPBs advice and “rewetting our land”, as their head
of water policy would like, forget it. If song thrushes on farmland only flourish
through agricultural depression, then I’d rather live without them. Blackbirds
will do for me.

April 28th
Last Effort With the Old Forms
It’s Monday morning. I am sitting in what passes for my office contemplating
the paper work that has to be done for the coming week. It’s actually the spare
bedroom in the house that Jim built for us, when we handed over our share of
the farmhouse to him and Bev. The little room we intended for an office faces
north, with very little view, whereas this room looks out south and east over
acres of farmland. All the cattle are now out for the summer, and, looking out
of my windows, I can almost do the daily inspection with a pair of binoculars.
Sitting in an office in glorious weather is not really the place to be, but as this
is my contribution to the work of the farm these days, needs must.
At least this year, much of the form filling is for the last time. I sent off
the annual PAYE returns, with a letter asking the Inland Revenue to remove
us from their list of employers. That should save a chunk of the Brazilian rain
forest being delivered by our postman at regular intervals. I am about to send
off the last application we shall ever make for beef special premium on steers.
There will be one final Suckler Cow form to do in July, and an application for
Extensification Grant next February. And that will be it.
Meanwhile, I have the last quarter’s VAT returns to complete, which I doubt
will ever go away, and it is IACS time again, hopefully the last time we have
to do it in its present form. Actually, over the years it has become relatively
easy to complete. I even contemplated attempting it ‘on line’ this year with
some encouragement from DEFRA, but seeing that everything will change next
May, it didn’t seem worth the effort. I feel sorry for the dairy boys having to
go through the performance for the first time, buying OS maps of the farm,
reading reams of instructions, setting out the ‘Field Data Printouts’ and so on,
just to be ready to apply for the Single Farm Payment this time next year.
172

Apr 28th

Last Effort With the Old Forms

And what about next year? Naively, I assumed when the Commission first
proposed the SFP idea a couple of years ago, that a simple form from each of
us, indicating how many acres of our farm we considered eligible for payment,
would be all that was required. Some hope! We haven’t yet been told what
evidence we shall have to produce each year to prove we are entitled to farm the
acres on which we are claiming. Worse still, we don’t know what is meant by
cross-compliance. There was talk to begin with of just having to run a mower
over the farm once a year, which would be accepted as keeping the land in
“Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition”.
DEFRA have recently issued a consultation paper on cross-compliance so
I went into their website to see how their proposals would affect us. I almost
wish I hadn’t – there were over 50 pages of it. I am beginning to get a nasty
feeling that, unless the organisations that represent us are very tough in their
response to DEFRA, the IACS that is coming may be more complicated than
the one we now have. The first priority appears to be the requirement to have a
“Soil Management Plan”, whatever that is. Does it mean having a list of rules,
such as ensuring that the topsoil in a field doesn’t wash into the road during a
violent thunderstorm, which one promises to abide by? Or does it mean having
all the fields regularly tested for nutrient status, and rectifying them, which is
quite another matter? The former is just common sense, but the latter, for
those of us who are used to farming ‘by the seat of our pants’, the result could
be pretty expensive.
There is plenty more like that, which I won’t go into, but it will certainly
pay us to make our views known by the deadline of 20th June. Most of the
conditions are already covered by directives and regulations under which we
farm now, but it looks as if in future, any breaches will be reported to the
Rural Payments Agency, who will then impose financial penalties. And there is
apparently a range of about 18 statutory agencies, which will have the right to
inspect us. DEFRA is generously endeavouring to ensure that we don’t get too
many inspectors asking the same questions. But ‘big brother’ will certainly be
watching us. To think that I believed that after this year the farm paper work
in general and the red tape in particular might at last decline.

Waking up to a Changing World
Last Thursday’s striking Western Morning View picture entitled ‘Parallel Lines’
showed very clearly the arable tramlines in a field of winter corn. It set me
thinking of the many changes to the farming landscape that have occurred in
the last 50 years. What would I notice most about the look of our countryside
if I had fallen asleep under the hedge, like some latter day Rip Van Winkle,
when I first went to work on a farm in 1947, and had woken up today? One
obvious answer is ‘colour’. Another, not so obvious, is ‘tramlines’.
I suppose the biggest single colour change, very visible at this time of year,
would have to be the brash yellow flowers of oilseed rape, now such an essential
crop on most arable farms. Later in the season, the much pleasanter blue of
linseed fields, rarely grown in those days, is becoming a familiar sight, and I
even occasionally see cornfields plastered with red poppies, which farmers would
have been ashamed to own in the past.
Something that would take me completely by surprise, if I had never seen it
before, would be the sight of whole fields covered in a film of plastic, appearing
from a distance like undulating sheets of water. Being novel, it seems to be
generally disapproved of by the public, but for weed control in root crops and
horticulture, it is surely better than using sprays. We can sell food in unopenable plastic wrapping, but if we use it to grow that food, we’re in trouble.
There are many smaller changes that have resulted in the disappearance of
those features that had been part of the working landscape for generations and
are recalled with nostalgia - the hay stacks and corn ricks dotted around on
every farm for much of the year, and the harvest fields with their rows of corn
shocks, now only seen occasionally where thatching wheat is grown. The sight
of silage clamps in open fields has come and gone, replaced with long mounds
of round bales along field margins. If they too eventually disappear, will that
evoke a similar feeling of regret?
Which brings me to those tramlines in arable fields. Of all the changes that
have taken place since I was a lad, that one, for me, most precisely divides
the old from the new when looking at farmland. I am always amused if I am
watching something like an Agatha Christie TV episode, set in the 1930’s, with
Captain Hastings driving Poirot in an exact period vintage car, through villages
carefully stripped of every TV aerial in sight, but surrounded by meticulously
tramlined arable acres stretching to the horizon. I wonder sometimes if film
directors are aware that before the 1970s, tramlines in cornfields didn’t exist.
174

May 12th

Language Barrier and Distance Block

Had I seen them years ago, I might have assumed the farmer hadn’t realized
that one of the spouts of his corn drill had become blocked.
I don’t think people outside farming fully understand the significance of
these regular lines through the majority of drilled crops. I believe the idea for
arable tramlining originated at a French agricultural college, where they were
trying to overcome the damage to the growing crop that was caused by tractor
wheels when spraying or spreading fertilizers. We all remember crop spraying
from the air, which is very successful in prairie farming, but very hazardous and
inaccurate in the comparatively smaller fields of Europe.
What was a very simple idea, which anyone could have thought of, has
in fact revolutionized crop production. With the crop undamaged by tractor
wheels, fertilizer and spray can now be applied for much longer through the
growing season with much greater precision and often in smaller quantities.
Yields have more than doubled since I started farming and the trend looks set
to continue. All because of those ubiquitous parallel lines that the public now
take for granted.
There is one thing that might just turn the clock back, and one way in which
period dramas could be filmed once more against an authentic background. If
you see a cornfield without tramlines, it is probably being grown organically.
With organic farming possibly in the ascendancy, who knows if parallel lines
may not one day go the way of hay stacks and corn ricks, but somehow I doubt
it.

On May 1st, the day the ten new member states joined the EU, Jenny and I
were travelling by coach to France. We were with our local twinning association
on its biennial pilgrimage to St Gatien des Bois in Normandy. Morchard Bishop
has built up very strong links with the people of St Gatien over the 25 years
since ‘twinning’ started, with visits in only a couple of years being missed, the
foot and mouth year obviously being one. Jenny and I are not very active
members, this was only our third trip, but as usual everything seemed to go
without a hitch, thanks to the outstanding efforts of the secretary and organising
committee.
Aside from the food and wine, and on this occasion a day in Paris, one of
the reasons I was keen to go this year was to see at first hand how the French
viewed the enlargement of the EU. We were out of touch with the news, TV
or papers, for the five days we were away and I wouldn’t have known that
175

2004
anything momentous in Europe had occurred. When asked, our hosts were a
little concerned about the possibility of more migrant workers, but the local
interest centred on the forthcoming celebrations marking the 60th anniversary
of the D-day landings, which is very relevant to that area of France. I doubt
if there will be any renewal of the ‘twinning’ idea with links being forged with
the new member states. Is the distance involved, or perhaps the language, too
great a barrier to overcome?
The schedule was so tight, as is usual on these visits, that I was unable to
get the chance to speak to any local farmers about CAP reform. I have heard
very little about how it is being introduced in the other member states, but if
here in England officials are dreaming up pettifogging regulations that are not
likely to be enforced elsewhere, it would help to know in advance; at least we
could try and block them before they are cast in tablets of stone. When talking
to French farmers in the past, I have had the impression that they have as much
trouble with officialdom as we do, but there the art of turning a blind eye is
better developed.
We saw a lot of the Normandy countryside from the coach as we travelled
around. The orchards were in full blossom and there seemed to be many more
sheep than when I was there last. Not big flocks, but a few sheep in almost every
orchard. I can’t believe the French are thinking of refusing to allow support
payments for apple growers as we are here, if the orchards are not grazed.
Grubbing up apple trees and a shortage of calvados in Normandy would start
another revolution. And what about vineyards - are they considered as farmland
or permanent cropping?
One of our stops was to visit a 50-acre horse-breeding farm where they were
keeping Percherons for show and sale, bringing them over in the summer to
the heavy horse shows in England. The farm grew some corn for feeding the
horses as well as the hay and grazing, but only half the area will be eligible for
the single farm payment, which indicates an historical payment based only on
their arable acres. I didn’t like to ask if they ate their horses at the end of their
showing career; they gave the impression of viewing their horses very much as we
do. Talking of horsemeat, I was surprised to see in the huge supermarket near
Le Havre, where we were buying our drink allowance on the homeward journey
(the weight of the coach for the ferry is the limiting factor), that the horsemeat
counter contained nearly as much imported from Argentina as locally produced.
Is it just a case of shortage or are the supermarkets using South America to
keep down prices as they are with beef here?
A final thought on the new European Union – I understand that the number
176

May 19th

Ploughing as Far as Carlisle

of Polish farmers is greater than the total number of all the farmers in the rest
of Europe. The Commission will soon put a stop to that!

May 19th
Ploughing as Far as Carlisle
Suddenly, our thirty acres of arable land is a sea of white plastic. We normally
grow barley and oats for the cattle and sheep, the straw providing most of our
requirements for winter bedding. In recent years, since my brother-in-law Jack
gave up his livestock, he has been letting his grass keep but has continued, with
our help, growing corn, which we buy at harvest. Since our farms are adjacent,
the collaboration has worked well, allowing us to put all our land into grass.
However, growing corn continuously for too many years, even though the three
fields have alternated between oats and barley and spring and autumn sowing,
is not the cleverest way to farm, and with a fair reserve of corn in store, it was
decided to put the ground into roots this year. Hence the white plastic.
Jack has let the fields to Peter May of Clannaborough, to grow swedes for
human consumption. West Country Swedes Ltd, the trading name under which
Peter operates, is one of only three suppliers to ASDA. Peter, who started with
one field of swedes as a young 22year old in 1976, now grows 650 acres a year,
some of it on his own land, but with the need for clean ground so essential
against problems like club-root, much of the acreage is through one year rentals
on farms in the South West. And even further afield – Peter has growers in
Portugal under contract to cover those times in the year when swedes would be
unavailable here.
So, unusually, our stubble fields remained unploughed through the winter, providing some extra feed for the birds. Last week the thirty acres were
ploughed in just over one day. Jack, now in his eighties, went out to cast an
eye on things. He told me they were using a 200 horsepower tractor, probably
one of the largest he has had working on the farm. It reminded him of the first
time he ploughed those fields in 1940. My in-laws, who were farming about
ten miles away before the war, had bought the farm the previous autumn, but
didn’t move into the farmhouse until the following year. Jack, then a 20 year
old, started ploughing the arable ground ready for spring tilling, cycling the ten
miles morning and evening. He ploughed with two horses and a single furrow
swing plough, covering about an acre a day. He said he got home at night quite
satisfied with his days work, but after switching to tractor ploughing in later
years, wouldn’t dream of going back to the old ways.
177

2004
Out of interest, I calculated how far Jack must have walked that first winter.
He didn’t actually plough all thirty acres, but had he done so, assuming about
ten miles to the acre, he would have ploughed a straight furrow roughly from
here to Carlisle, just short of the Scottish border. In fact he only ploughed one
of the three fields, which would have taken him to Gloucester. And all done
plodding in the furrow in hobnail boots and leather gaiters - no wellingtons in
those days, and looking after the horses morning and evening - no self-starters.
He is still very active and would thoroughly enjoy the chance to try ploughing
with 200 horsepower, sitting in a comfortable cab listening to the radio, but I
wonder how fit today’s youngsters will be when they reach his age.
Meanwhile the swedes are already sown and the ground covered in very fine
mesh plastic netting. Peter tells me it is imported from China, and has to
be reused four or five times to cover the expense. I am very interested to see
it in action close-to for the first time. I understand it is an organic way of
protecting the plants against insect pests, to which swedes are very vulnerable.
If it reduces the need for insecticide sprays, I am all in favour. And the 25
species of butterfly found on our farm would go along with that.

Cows Mobbed a Dying Buzzard
A couple of weeks ago, we noticed that the neighbour’s heifers were behaving
in a very strange fashion in a corner of their field. The whole herd, about fifty
of them, were milling around like a rolling maul in a rugby scrum. Something
on the ground seemed to be upsetting them and they were pushing and shoving
to take it in turns to nuzzle at whatever it was. It was obviously alive, but
from were we were, four fields away, it was impossible to identify it even with
binoculars. I guessed it was a young or injured badger that they were attacking,
but I didn’t think I could get there in time to make any difference. Four hours
later, the heifers were still in a cluster around the spot, so I walked across to
investigate. It turned out to be a buzzard, by that time very dead, although
not obviously trampled. The heifers were reluctant to allow me to get close,
and I had to push in among them to take a look.
Why the strange behaviour I have no idea. Cattle will take an interest in
anything unusual in their field, but not usually for that length of time. They
were still returning to inspect the bird that evening, and the ground around
the area is brown and grassless now a fortnight later. I suspect the buzzard
must have been old or perhaps weakened in a fight for breeding territory – we
178

May 26th

Cows Mobbed a Dying Buzzard

have birds nesting locally every year – but for whatever reason it was obviously
unable to take off quickly enough to avoid the cattle.
With all the concern about the high rate of TB cases in the South West
at present, the incident brought home to me the need to eliminate diseased
badgers from cattle farms. Had that been a dying TB-infected badger, there is
little doubt that those heifers would have all been infected. I have seen our own
cattle behave in a similar way, where there has been a dead badger in a field,
but never before witnessed that extreme interest shown in a dying animal.
I have written about TB and badgers before in this column and I hope
I am not going to repeat myself, but I make no apology for coming back to
the subject after reading the comments made by Ben Bradshaw at the Devon
County Show. He talks about developing a TB test for badgers and carrying out
field trials before considering issuing licences for culls. Meanwhile farmers, like
Tony Yewdall, with his irreplaceable herd of pedigree Guernseys, find themselves
in an impossible situation where no matter what action they take, the fate of
their animals is out of their control.
If the badgers on an infected farm, where large numbers of cattle are going
down, are carrying TB, then they should be culled. Until that is done, there is
no long-term future for cattle on that farm. It is a simple matter to take fresh
samples from badger latrines, or even urine contaminated soil and test them
for the bacilli. If there is no evidence of TB, then I can understand DEFRA’s
reluctance to issue a cull licence, but is this being done in these high profile
cases? We don’t have enough time to start talking about testing the badgers
themselves. Every badger sett has its own exclusive latrine, which removes any
doubt about which badgers should be culled. If there is evidence of TB in a
badger colony, then the whole colony should be taken out immediately and the
sett filled in completely and kept filled in for a number of years.
In the longer term, there is another aspect of this problem, which I don’t
think has been sufficiently explored. I have often said that the increased acreage
of forage maize on dairy farms is the most significant factor in the explosion in
badger numbers – having a much greater effect than the legislation protecting
badgers and their setts. In a county like Devon, which is very rich in badger
habitat, providing a food source that is ideal for preparing badgers for the
lean winter months and thus ensuring that more sow badgers are in breeding
condition, must result in an increasing population. We saw that happen here
on this farm and we have seen the reverse occur in the last few years. Since
both we and our closest neighbours have given up growing maize, I believe our
badger numbers have declined quite significantly.
179

2004
The danger of this scenario for the badger is that there is no corresponding
increased food source in the spring and early summer to avoid malnutrition
and even in some years, as I have witnessed, actual starvation. Throw in the
presence of TB in the area and you have a recipe for disaster. If I was a young
man going into dairy farming again, I would still grow maize, but I would
seriously consider electric-fencing it against badgers, which is relatively easy,
for the few weeks when the cobs are ripening before harvest, and I would hope
all my maize growing neighbours would follow suit.

June 2nd
High Price of Asbestos
I wonder how much all our barn roofs weigh. I was pondering that rather
abstruse question after talking to a friend, who has just completed an asbestos
risk management course. He was telling me that the cost of getting rid of
asbestos legally is currently about £400 a ton. Since most of our barn roofs are
made of asbestos cement sheeting, it looks as if it will cost more to take down
our covered yards at some date in the future than it cost to put them up. Not
that our buildings are anywhere near due for demolition yet, in fact they are
for the most part in very good order.
We are about to do our asbestos risk assessment survey, which is what
brought up the subject. It looks like being fairly straight forward and, aside
from more paper work, will no doubt mean another notice being tacked onto
each building, reminding people working on the roof of the risk of developing
asbestosis in later life, to add to the probability of an abrupt descent to a
concrete floor.
With deaths from asbestosis now running at over 3000 a year, roughly the
same as deaths from road accidents, there is obviously a need to take every
precaution possible, but it does bring home the uncertainties of life. I would
never have believed that an agricultural roofing material, which we all welcomed
as long-lasting, reliable and maintenance free, to replace rusting corrugated iron,
would pose any threat to human health.
The terrific upsurge in its use coincided with the farm buildings grant
scheme, introduced by our own Derek Heathcote Amory, later Lord Amory,
ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer, during his time as Minister of Agriculture in
the mid 1950s. With the race for expansion in food production, that one scheme
did more in my opinion to change the face of farming, than any other political decision taken at the time. Existing buildings on most farms were being
outdated by mechanisation and increasing stock numbers, and those that were
180

Jun 9th

Idiotic Time Limit

adaptable often needed re-roofing after a wartime of neglect. We, ourselves,
took advantage of the 40% grant, which the scheme offered, to build two large
covered yards, one in 1962 and the second in 1974, around which the work of
the farm has since pivoted. There must be countless buildings all over the country almost exactly like them and all using asbestos cement sheeting for roofing.
There were numerous farm-building firms that sprang up at the time and I can’t
recall any of them seriously offering an alternative roofing material.
Eventually, all these buildings will have to be demolished. Even if the roofs
last, the uprights won’t survive, whatever they are made of. In the past, we have
been pretty adept at reusing farm-building materials until they have literally
disintegrated. If they haven’t been incorporated into new buildings, they have
been used to block holes in hedges or laid down as hardcore on farm tracks.
But in this case, not any more.
Every single sheet of asbestos cement currently on farms is going to have
to be very carefully transported and expensively buried in a designated landfill
site. I suppose over a long number of years we shall absorb the cost. And it is
not as if there is really very much danger from this particular type of asbestos
– it is the white variety which, compared with the blue, is relatively innocuous,
and there is only 12% in roofing sheets. What really worries me is the likely
reaction of our insurance companies. Perhaps there is something to be said for
stone, wood and thatch!

June 9th
Idiotic Time Limit
When is a permanent pasture not a permanent pasture? Answer - when it is part
of the cross compliance proposals for the Single Farm Payments. It seems that
some idiot in the EU Commission has defined “permanent pasture” as farmland
that has been down to grass for more than five years. As any farmer will tell
you, that is a long way short of a correct definition of permanent pasture. Has
no one in Brussels ever heard of long rotational farming, using grass leys of up
to seven or eight years, which are then ploughed up to grow corn and roots for
three or four years?
By no stretch of the imagination are these grass fields permanent pasture.
They are comprised mainly of ryegrass and white clover, sometimes with the
addition of timothy or cocksfoot, and are used for grazing, but are always cut at
least once every year for silage or haymaking. This is the way we have always
farmed on our rolling Devon upland and it is the way many of the livestock
farmers in the southwest have managed the land for generations. These are not
181

2004
the lush river valleys with their deep alluvial soils; they are often thin acid soils
overlying shale or clay and if left too long without sight of the plough, seem to
dry out and lose productivity. Ploughing every so often, breaking up the old
sward, getting decent yields of corn and roots in relatively clean ground, with
the minimum need to fertilize or spray, and then sowing back to long leys is an
old and trusted system of farming. It is not intensive farming, quite the reverse
as our abundant wildlife clearly shows.
There are a number of anomalies in DEFRA’s proposals for cross compliance
that need to be challenged; their detailed measures for the protection of soil
are probably the worst and look like being a nightmare for arable farmers,
especially those growing potatoes and swedes. These and some of the more
peripheral points like the number of trees allowed in an orchard and the length
of time between topping unfarmed land are doubtless being tackled by the
farming unions. However, the question of what is or is not permanent pasture
seems to slipping through relatively unchallenged. It is a Commission proposal
and not something DEFRA is trying to foist on to us, but I doubt if anyone
in DEFRA understands the long-term implications for farmers like ourselves.
This intention to designate all land that has been down to grass for five years
as permanent is wholly unacceptable.
All our land has been grass for more than five years and we will be obliged
to register it as such on our first payment application. Thereafter we will not
be allowed to change its status without prior consent, and the rules for change
are ridiculously narrow. And yet, about 40% of our farm, according to our 2003
IACS application, is registered as temporary grass and is eligible for arable
aid, if we chose to plough it up. Some of it is due for ploughing, but with all
the uncertainties at present, I don’t think we were intending to tackle it this
autumn. I suppose we might try and get round the regulation by ploughing
up a large proportion of our leys and growing corn for just one year in order
to register those acres as arable. We may already be too late. May 15 of this
year is already fixed as the date for measuring total permanent pasture for each
Member State.
I thought the whole idea of the reform of the CAP was to “free up farmers
to produce what the market and consumers want rather than what the subsidy regimes dictate”. Not my words – they are in the introduction to the cross
compliance consultation document. On our farm they sound pretty hollow. Not
that I’m against preserving real permanent pastures. We have some ground that
has been unploughed for over 40 years, and those fields are likely to stay that
way. But if we are to be allowed to farm as the future dictates, this sort of
straightjacket must be removed. I intend to write to DEFRA before the 20th
182

Jun 16th

Wonderful Hedgerow Flowers

June deadline, and I hope other farmers are intending to do the same. Individuals writing will enormously strengthen the chances of persuading DEFRA to
stand up to the Commission on this occasion.
Failing that, I suppose there is the faint chance that we may suddenly find
ourselves making a reasonable profit out of food production, to the extent that
we can cock a snook at the cross compliance regulations and just get on with
the job. Pigs might fly, and ours probably will before then. Jim has just bought
eight Tamworth weaners to let loose in our woods.

June 16th
Wonderful Hedgerow Flowers
We have just finished making silage and the next week should see us well into
haymaking, weather permitting. We run the one into the other, with the headlands of the fields furthest from the buildings topping up the silage clamp,
leaving plenty of space for hay turning and baling. In a catchy season, silaging
tends to go on until we can get no more into the barn, but with the present
dry spell, half our mowing grass looks like ending up as hay. It is a system
that has worked well for us since we switched from dairy cows to sucklers; it
doesn’t produce the best quality silage, but for our beef cattle quantity is more
important.
It has been a wonderful spring and early summer. The hedgerow flowers have
been the best I can remember. Some years the primroses are outstanding, other
years it is bluebells or campions that dominate, but this year they have all done
well. Interestingly, I have noticed that there are many more wild flowers on the
roadside hedge banks than there used to be, and generally more than you find
on the field sides. The only exception is where a hedge has been laid during the
previous winter, and that hedge starts the spring comparatively bare. It leads
me to the conclusion that the flail hedge trimmer, so often slammed in the letters
columns of the press, is actually increasing the flower populations when used
heavily in July, in an attempt to widen our narrow country lanes sufficiently for
two-way traffic. Although it may not suit wing-mirrors or nesting birds, wild
flowers certainly appear to benefit. Maybe that’s not the explanation, merely
more evidence of global warming.
The blossom has also been extraordinary this year, and that certainly has
nothing to do with hedge trimming. There was a spell a week ago when you
could have been excused for thinking there had been a wedding down our way.
There was a carpet of what appeared to be pink and white confetti down each
side of our lane as the may blossom went over its time. And the hedges are
183

2004
now plastered with yellow honeysuckle. The only cloud on the horizon is the
possibility of a very dry summer ahead, which doesn’t bode well for aftermaths
on our light land. Some of our best grazing pastures are too far to have mains
water troughs and rely on streams for cattle drinking. In past years these have
continued to run sufficiently until mid-July, but are already drying up. Unless
we get heavy rain in the next ten days, which won’t make hay making any
easier, these pastures will be of little use to us until the autumn. We are not
given to carting water about except in emergencies, so perhaps we shall have to
look to some reservoir building if this weather is likely to be the norm in future.
I could have guessed we would be thinking like this by now when I wandered
round a very fine Devon County Show; our best years are always the ones when
the Show has been a wash out.

June 23rd
UKIP Should Rethink
Like all good citizens, I went along to our village hall a couple weeks ago and cast
my vote for a local MEP. I have been voting in that same village hall for over 50
years now, for district councillors, county councillors, MPs and, more recently,
MEPs and I haven’t missed many chances to vote. Not that I’m claiming to be
particularly worthy, merely that on those occasions that I’ve been too busy to
bother, I’ve subsequently felt in no position to complain about the election of
someone I considered an ineffective politician. As usual on this occasion, Jenny
and I were the only people voting at that particular moment. No doubt, in the
course of the day the scattered electorate of our parish rolled up in ones and
twos, to give the attendant officials the satisfaction of knowing that at least
they had ensured we had a free and secret ballot.
However, I wonder how much longer this will continue. From the apparent
success of this year’s trials, postal voting seems to be coming in, and remote
rural areas would be an obvious choice for a wider application. Myself, I am not
too happy at the idea, but perhaps I’m just old fashioned. For a start, I don’t
altogether trust the postal system – the errors that have occurred with cattle
movement notifications to BCMS do not encourage a feeling of confidence. Nor
do I think that essential element of secrecy is best preserved this way. I can
see party helpers going round collecting postal votes, rather than the present
system of offering lifts to the polling booths. My mind goes back to the Milk
Board elections, although I admit the shenanigans were due to the fact that
some dairy farmers were more equal than others.
184

Jun 23rd

UKIP Should Rethink

What really did bother me about this recent election was the realisation
that I can no longer have my say on who should represent me in the European
Parliament. I can choose a political party but not a person. I resent that
vigorously. Why should a bunch of party zealots decide an order of merit that
I have to accept? We are rapidly going that way in national elections now that
party allegiance has to be included with the candidate’s name on the ballot
paper. I prefer to vote for the person and not the party. If at some future date,
my MP decides to change sides, that used to be all right with me, but now I
could well feel entitled to demand a by-election. I suspect my attitude stems
from the fact that farming is more a way of life than just a job, and that the
agricultural industry deserves to be above party politics.
For that reason I can well understand, why many farmers appeared to be
backing UKIP. We are all frequently exasperated by the seemingly petty regulations that pour out of Brussels. My current gripe is the fact that some lunatic
there has decided that any land where the vegetation has remained unploughed
for five years, and that includes set aside, is now defined as permanent pasture.
UKIP’s success, by drawing support from both main parties, has certainly
focused public debate on our place in Europe. And as always when the shortcomings of the EU are discussed, the CAP and it’s cost to our exchequer comes
to the fore. As a farmer, I have no doubt at all that the CAP has on balance
been of great benefit to Britain’s farmers. I have asked farmers who feel otherwise how they suggest we might now be better off, and the answer usually
centres on the retention of a Milk Marketing Board and a system of deficiency
payments. The former was fast becoming an anachronism when it was wound
up – unfortunately in my opinion it was wound up very badly or we might
still be dairy farming – and deficiency payments would never have survived the
Thatcher years.
So what if the unthinkable happened and we came out of Europe? The
thought led me to check the UKIP manifesto on their website. They propose
a voluntary Land Management Scheme where, to use their words, “individual
farmers are invited to draw up specific contracts in respect of their farms in
which the style of land use and management would be agreed. This would
include such parameters as crops grown, methods of cultivation, employment
levels, animal stocking density and types of husbandry, pesticide and herbicide
use, public access, wildlife conservation and similar factors. Support would be
calculated on the basis of the notional income, which would be generated by
a highly intensive farm – where production efficiency was the only criterion.
Payments would reimburse farmers for notional losses.”
185

2004
IACS has been a kitten to all that – if UKIP wants to be taken seriously by
farmers, that needs sinking without trace.

June 30th
Sheep and Lambs Shorn in a Wind Tunnel
It is amazing how quickly the weather can change. A couple of weeks ago, as we
finished silage making, I was convinced we were heading for a very dry summer.
You may remember me complaining that the streams which water the cattle in
some of our further pastures had all but dried up. Then almost overnight it
was back to a typical English June. Wind and rain one day, sunshine the next.
And apart from the fact that we are still waiting to make hay, it couldn’t have
been more welcome. That is except on the day we were sheep shearing – last
Wednesday, the worst day of summer so far.
Rain was forecast on the Tuesday, and Bev very wisely brought all the sheep
into the covered yard early that morning just in case. Sure enough it rained,
but with the wind in the southeast and the yard gates facing west, the sheep
stayed dry. Our two shearers were due the following morning, so the weather
could do what it liked. And sure enough it did. We woke up to a howling
westerly gale with a scattering of rain straight out of the Atlantic.
The shearers arrived about nine and set up ready to start, while Jim laid
out boards to tie the fleeces on. They all went in for a cup of coffee, in the
hope the wind might die down a little. Ten o’clock and, if anything, the wind
had gathered strength. The shearers had another farm to do that afternoon, so
they got going. I went down to lend a hand with the wool. In all the years, I
have never known shearing conditions like it. We have shorn sheep in scorching
sun and, under cover, in pouring rain, but never in what was virtually a wind
tunnel. Jim fetched two silage trailers and parked them across the gateway, but
it made little difference.
The ewes were difficult enough, the fleeces getting wrapped around the shearers’ legs or ending up back on the sheep. If you could get the fleece away in
one piece, rolling it up was another matter. The first one I laid out, lifted six
inches off the floor and flew away across the shed like some magic carpet. It
was a case of holding it down with two hands and rolling it up with the third
hand you didn’t have.
The lambs were a different problem. Bev is retaining a number of ewe lambs
this year for breeding, so it seemed sensible to do these while the shearers were
here. As you know, lambs wool comes off loose and not as a fleece. That
day, loose was an understatement. Downwind of the shearers it looked like
186

Jul 7th

Harry Sparks a Hunt

a snowstorm. Jim and I did the best we could, either gathering as much as
possible straight off the cutting head or, in my case, crouching down like a
wicket keeper by the shearers legs and trying to catch it as it went by. It is a
consolation that the value of wool is nothing like it used to be.

July 7th
Harry Sparks a Hunt
It is two years now since I was first asked to write this weekly column for
Wednesday’s farming section. For someone who has studiously avoided putting
pen to paper from his earliest schooldays and who became a farmer in the hope
that a signature would be the longest bit of writing needed to see him through
life, it was a daunting prospect. As anyone who knows me will tell you, I can
talk the hind legs off the proverbial donkey, but putting my thoughts down on
paper is quite another matter. In practice, although my grammar leaves much
to be desired, subject matter has proved unexpectedly easy. Generally it is
either about what has happened on the farm during the week or my opinion of
the latest topic to hit the farming headlines. Or again, as this week, a bit of
both.
On the farm, Harry, the Jack-Russell terrier, is a very lucky little dog.
He doesn’t really deserve to be with us any more. On Wednesday morning,
Bessie the Labrador appeared after a bit of rabbiting, without him - they are
normally inseparable. By evening, he hadn’t come home and Jim and Bev
were beginning to worry. Thursday morning still no dog, and it was a case
of ringing the neighbours to see if he had turned up anywhere. Bev had to
be away all day, and Jim, busy enough already, began the impossible task of
checking all the badger setts around us. I did the furthest end of our land,
which includes about seven setts, while doing the daily cattle round. No luck,
although calling, whistling and putting my head down a hole, didn’t fill me
with any great confidence that he wasn’t there. Jenny walked round their usual
rabbit hunting hedges, where Harry can sometimes be found digging furiously
with his back end sticking out of a rabbit burrow, and Bessie sitting patiently
for the action to begin. Not a sign.
Jim went on searching all afternoon, through the evening and into the darkness. I don’t know how many miles he walked or how many badger setts he
visited. Bev got home about half past two that night to find a grubby little dog
waiting to greet her in the back hall. Jim told me next morning that as the
night drew in, it became very much easier to hear sounds from a distance. At
around midnight, walking back from across the valley still calling and whistling,
187

2004
he heard a yelp that might have been Harry, from well over half a mile away. It
seemed to come from a sett not far from the farmhouse, which he had checked
earlier. Close to he’d heard nothing.
He came home, woke up Rachel, my granddaughter, and together, with
her holding the torch and using her younger ears to guide his digging, they
eventually reached a little grey nose pushing through the earth, the nostrils
flared, drawing in fresh air as if nearly asphyxiated. Jim grabbed him by the
head before he could pull back, but reckoned if it had been a badger instead of
Harry, whose muzzle doesn’t look much different, he could have ended up with
a very nasty bite. I wonder if Harry has learned his lesson. I doubt it - you
can’t teach a Jack Russell anything.
Writing on a Monday, as I usually do, the latest topic to hit the headlines
may be ‘old hat’ by the time you read this. If a large meteor were to hit the
earth tomorrow, mankind might well be heading for extinction by Wednesday
and you’d wonder why I hadn’t mentioned it. However the problems of the
current milk price for Westcountry dairy farmers have been hitting the headlines
for so long now, they are hardly likely to go away in the next few days.
We no longer milk cows, so perhaps I have no right to comment, but dairy
farming plays such a large part in the region’s agriculture that a general exodus
would affect us all. What I fail to understand is why 18 pence of the retail price
of liquid milk cannot be accounted for by a House of Commons Select Committee
Report on Milk Pricing. I was for many years involved with a dairy farmer milk
cooperative, and I don’t recall ever having any difficulty knowing where every
penny of the milk price ended up in those days. Farmer cooperatives own their
own processing plants now, so why all the uncertainty?
I have very little time for our Farm Minister, Margaret Beckett, at the best
of times, but if we can’t sort out something as simple but as vital to the case
for Government intervention as that, is it surprising she is washing her hands
of the whole affair?

July 14th
Woodfair Was Truly Wonderful
We went last Saturday to the South West Forest Woodfair at Roadford Lake. It
is the fourth year the event has been held, and with Jim’s interest in woodland
and timber production, it’s a day out that we never miss. Jim had taken stand
space this year, and with Jake Jackson, an oak timber framer, was exhibiting
a demonstration green oak building. I hitched a lift with Jim and Jake to get
188

Jul 14th

Woodfair Was Truly Wonderful

there before the opening ceremony and as we passed Okehampton, we hit the
rain, sheets of it, which didn’t auger too well for the day.
Roadford Lake is the most natural setting for the Woodfair. It couldn’t be
more central to Devon and Cornwall or have better road access, and with the
landscaping and tree planting beginning to give the impression that the lake has
always been there, I wonder how long before we forget that it is our prodigious
use of water that has made the site possible. Ian Mercer, Chairman of South
West Forest Partnership, performed the opening in his inimitable laidback way.
He gave us a flavour of the increased number of exhibitors and demonstrations
this year, a run down of the program of events and woodworking competitions,
and mentioned the growing interest worldwide in the use of wood as a serious
alternative to fossil fuel for heating. The Chairman of the South West Lakes
Trust, owners of the site, followed with an outline of the ambitious plans for
the future development of the lakeside.
Back outside, it was still steadily raining as visitors were arriving under
macs and umbrellas. The weather boys seemed to have got it wrong with their
forecast of sunny with a few showers. I had hardly started getting round what
looked like a better show than ever, when Jenny turned up with our neighbours,
Joe and June. However, as she’d come through the entrance gate, Jenny said
she had experienced a funny blurring in the sight of one eye, like looking through
a spider’s web of red lines. It sounded most alarming, and after a quick word
with the St. Johns Ambulance Brigade, who we tend to take for granted at
these events, we persuaded her that it ought to be checked out. I was thankful
for the rain, as had it been fine, I think she might have refused to spoil Joe
and June’s day; the red lines were beginning to break up and she was feeling
no pain.
Joe drove us the forty or so miles to Exeter, and we arrived at the R.D.&E.
Wonford ‘out patients’ just before 1 o’clock. Saturday mid-day seems to be a
good time for emergencies – there was hardly any one there, and Jenny was
seen in the eye department straight away. With drops in her eyes to enlarge the
pupils, we were told to go and have some lunch in the hospital restaurant and
be back in an hour when the doctor would be present to see her.
It turned out that Jenny had torn a small hole in a corner of the retina,
which can happen as one gets older and if untreated, can lead on to a detached
retina. She came out to the waiting room to tell us that she would only be an
hour and she was having the tear repaired by laser spot welding.
Sitting there waiting, I couldn’t help thinking what a funny old world we
live in. We’ve been welding up our farm machinery all the years I’ve been
farming. What farmer hasn’t dashed in to fetch the welder in an emergency in
189

2004
the middle of harvest? There’s a standing joke in the family about my brotherin-law Jack welding a crowbar into the combine when a crack appeared in the
chassis. And the one thing when welding that has to be guarded against is the
possible danger to one’s eyesight.
We were on our way home soon after 3 o’clock. Jenny had had over 200 shots
with a laser gun to seal the damage, had felt nothing and had no headache.
There’s really not a lot wrong with our health service. I was surprised it had
taken so little time, but the young chap operating had complained that it took
longer to do the necessary paperwork than the actual treatment. Now where
have I heard that before?
Meanwhile back at Roadford, Jim told me later that evening, the weather
had cleared up to a sunny afternoon, the Fair had been a great success with the
attendance well up to last year, and Jake had won first prize for his exhibit in
the Utility Woodwork competition.

Have you ever seen a hayfield turn blue overnight? I hadn’t until the other
morning, but I suppose to any farmer growing grass for seed production it’s a
common enough sight. The grass in this case was timothy, a small quantity of
which we often include in our ryegrass and white clover leys. The hayfield is
normally the last one to be cut, and I suppose over the years the timothy has
repeatedly reseeded itself, so that it is now the predominant grass. One night it
looked like an expanse of miniature green bulrushes, next morning in the early
sunlight it was transformed into a field of lavender. I guess an over night shower
had for once brought all the timothy heads into flower at the same moment, the
blue of the pollen producing the startling colour. It had faded by midday and
I never got a decent photo.
Another novelty for me this year is the sight of swedes growing under white
netlon. You may remember me writing about the May Farming Partnership
who are growing swedes on our arable ground. The swedes were only sown
eight weeks ago and the plants are already two feet high with swedes as big as
your fist. Interestingly, a small area of plants that the netlon didn’t cover have
hardly grown at all; they have been eaten by pigeons, and what plants remain
are being attacked by cabbage white caterpillars and swede flea-beetle. The
plants under the netting look untouched and totally protected, although I’ve no
doubt it’s not that simple – it certainly can’t be a cheap way to grow swedes
however environmentally friendly.

‘People Miles’ Concern

While shopping in Safeway last week, I made a point of looking to see where
the swedes on offer had come from. I was expecting them to have been grown
in one of the Mediterranean countries, as Supermarket early potatoes so often
are, but I was astonished to find they had been imported from New Zealand.
It seems an awfully long way to bring what must be a low value food in weight
terms. I rang Sarah May to ask if Devon swedes were ever exported out of the
UK, and she tells me that they do export to Europe, particularly Germany at
certain times of the year, although she is as concerned about ‘food miles’ as the
rest of us.
I find the whole subject of food miles a very difficult one on which to make
an informed judgement. Obviously for freshness, the closer to home food is
grown the better. Nothing tastes quite like veg straight out of the garden. At
the other extreme, beef eats best after it has been hung for a month - so a little
travelling is no great disadvantage except for cost. “Ah, but what about global
warming and saving the planet” I hear the ‘greens’ cry. “We must save energy
wherever possible”.
I read somewhere that the food you buy in a Supermarket has travelled on
average a thousand miles. I have no idea if that’s true, but there is more to
it than just distance. I went round a food-processing factory with a group of
farmers a couple of years ago, and the subject of sugar buying came up. The
manager explained that for patriotic reasons they always used homegrown sugar,
but that it would actually be cheaper to buy their sugar from the Caribbean.
What was most surprising was the fact that the fossil fuel energy used in the
production of that sugar from sugar cane plus the ocean transport, was less
than the fossil fuel used to grow and process sugar in the UK from sugar beet.
Distance was an advantage in that particular case.
Out of interest, I have done a rough calculation to see how much energy
would be used if your family Sunday lunch of meat and two veg had been
grown in Scotland and purchased down here in a local Supermarket. Assuming
a 500-mile journey and a 25-ton load, it works out that the proportion of fuel
needed for the transport of your meal would be just two spoonfuls of diesel. If
you then jumped into your car to nip the two miles to the pub for an after lunch
drink, you would probably use more than ten times that amount in petrol, not
to mention leaving the dishwasher in full flow back home. If you don’t believe
me, work it out for yourself - perhaps I’ve got it wrong. Surely it’s ‘people
miles’ that we should really be worrying about.

Beckett’s Fuddled Thinking
Last Saturday was the day of our local agricultural show, the Mid Devon at
Tiverton and what a difference a year makes! Records crowds, livestock entries
back to pre FMD days, perfect weather – fine but not too hot – and overfull car
parks. Everyone looked happy including the stewards and especially Amanda
Williams, the new treasurer. And a year ago – mud, mud, not glorious mud,
just liquid mud filling your shoes and plastering your legs; so much mud that
the show ground and main car park has had to be completely reseeded. Even so,
last year’s show will stick in my memory for far longer than this year’s, chiefly
for the extraordinary cheerfulness of everyone there. What a pity our beloved
farm minister, Margaret Beckett, could not have been present; she might have
begun to understand what farmers and farming are all about.
Her latest efforts to consign our industry to the history books was certainly
one of the first things discussed as I met friends and acquaintances, one of the
big attractions for me of these local shows. In Devon, we should all by now have
received the first of the barrage of forms we shall have to come to grips with
to receive our ‘Single Farm Payment’. There are four in this batch that need
our attention. The first sets out DEFRA’s estimates of our entitlements, which
we must return corrected within 28 days of receipt or their figures will stand.
For many of us this is the busiest month of the farming year. What I don’t
understand is how DEFRA can be sure when, or even if, we have received the
form, the postal system being what it is. The second form is already obsolete
and has been superseded by a new version, which will arrive shortly. If you’ve
sent yours back, you can reclaim it and do it again. If this is Mrs Beckett’s idea
of a reduction in form filling and red tape, as she originally trumpeted the new
payments system, heaven help us.
However, the real talking point among farmers at the moment is Mrs Beckett’s decision to include a two-meter uncultivated strip round each field as part
of the cross compliance regulations. Does she really know what she’s doing, except that she was astute enough to announce it as MPs went off for their summer
break? I suspect that someone in one of the environmental groups persuaded
her that it was an opportunity not to be missed. That should help all the birds
and butterflies we farmers are doing our best to eradicate. I understand that
the farming lobby then had a go at her, and she backtracked to allow the two
meters to be measured from the centre of the hedge. For many of us in Devon,
that’s a laugh - our hedgebanks are not far off four meters thick already. But I
object strongly to being turned into an inchworm measuring the hedgerows in
192

Aug 4th

Are Forecasts Going Haywire?

case we inadvertently break the rules by the width of a tractor tyre. I object
even more strongly that those of us who have maintained our hedges in the past
now have this to worry about. A wire fence round a field, which is not much
used by birds except to perch on, is exempt from the regulation. That’s a funny
way for Mrs Beckett to reward the environmentally conscious farmer.
Nor do I understand why we are going to be restricted from ploughing to
the edge of a cornfield as we always have done. It would make sense to ask us to
leave a margin unsown and unsprayed to allow arable weeds to flourish, but to
insist on an uncultivated grassy strip seems pretty pointless. On arable farms,
this is likely to become absorbed into the hedge over the years. Perhaps some
agricultural historian in the future will be puzzled why hedgerows in England
are all exactly four meters wide, but are variable in the rest of the UK, where
more sense seems to have prevailed.
To cap it all, Mrs Beckett completely forgot, when she dreamed up this
idea, that the hardest hit by the loss of farmable land, would be those of us
with that most cherished of landscapes, small fields. I believe she is hurriedly
attempting to put this right by making an exception for fields of less than five
acres. But what about farms with fields averaging six, seven or eight acres? We
certainly fall into that category and I doubt if many outside farming can tell
the difference.

August 4th
Are Forecasts Going Haywire?
We have finished haymaking at last, no thanks to the weathermen. Since moving
their headquarters down to Exeter, the national forecasts appear as accurate as
ever, but the local forecasts seem to have gone haywire. I am not trying to be
beastly to these lovely people - who could be to the likes of Michael ‘Hurricane’
Fish or our own, now retired, Craig Rich. Nor am I suggesting they’re getting it
completely wrong. In the immortal words of Eric Morecambe, they are playing
all the right notes, just getting them in the wrong order!
When it comes to haymaking, predicting the weather for four or five days
ahead needs to be pretty good. Certainly for most of July, this has not been the
impression we’ve had. Judging by the rather bleached looking hay I see all round
this area of Devon, other farmers seem to have been equally misled. Perhaps
the forecasts have been better for the South Hams and Cornwall, but farming
within 20 miles of the national Met Office with their two tonne supercomputers
and 1,000 staff, I was expecting pinpoint accuracy. A friend, who shall be
nameless, suggested that perhaps the local forecasts were increasingly aimed at
193

2004
the tourist trade with the emphasis on sunshine days to come. What a shame
if even with the weather, farming is dropping down the national pecking order.
In our case, Jim cut all four hayfields on the Friday, with a forecast of a
fine week, last week, to follow. He has been waiting for some time to start
haymaking, and normally would have cut in a sequence to spread the risk,
but with August approaching, never a good month for hay, he mowed the lot.
The Saturday and Sunday were fine and the hay was making nicely, with the
baling contractor booked for the Wednesday. What do we get on Monday and
Tuesday? No rain – just damp unbroken low cloud. Wednesday morning dawns
fine, and Jim’s back to feverishly turning the hay. Lunchtime, and the forecast
has now changed to possible heavy overnight rain. A fine week it’s turning
out to be. With the hay not really fit, the baler makes a hopeful start, but
has to stop after half a field. In the event, the heavy rain doesn’t materialise,
just enough to damp everything down again, but with two very hot days to
follow, all four fields are finally baled last Saturday. The hay’s not bad, but
it’s certainly not as good as it might have been, having merely dampened Jim’s
enthusiasm for haymaking.
That’s the trouble – haymaking is the most fraught undertaking on the farm.
There is nothing so good for feeding cattle and sheep as first class hay. It smells
good, it stores well, it doesn’t pollute, it reduces the slurry in the dung heap and
the animals thrive on it. On the other hand, poor quality or bullock hay as it’s
called, does little more than fill bellies and produce wind. And the difference
is mainly in the weather. You would think that with satellites and computers,
making hay these days would be a doddle, but it seems not.
In my early years it gave me many a restless night. There was really nothing
else for bulk feeding from December to March, and one had to learn to do it
well. It appeared at first sight to be an art form rather than a science, and as
a book-taught farmer, I didn’t find it easy. And when to start was the most
crucial bit. Weather lore you could bone up on, but every old saying seemed
to have an alternative that predicted the complete opposite. My favourite one,
which was useful for haymaking, used the expression ‘the fingers of God’, and
guaranteed a spell of fine weather for three weeks after an initial two or three
days rain. Unfortunately the old adage about ‘drawing water’, which looked
almost identical in the sky, indicated that the said water would continue falling
back again for the foreseeable future. I found it simpler to cut when the farmer
with the best local reputation for making good hay, cut his. Everyone else in
the neighbourhood did, so why should I, the new boy, buck the trend.
Life is much easier now, with most farms relying on silage or haylage, both
less vulnerable to the weather. And bringing home the hay is unbelievably
194

Aug 11th

DEFRA’s Tea Party

easier. I have farmed from carting loose hay in great four-wheeled horse-drawn
wagons, to hay sweeps fixed to the front of a tractor for ricking in the field, and
for many years now, loading and unloading trailer after trailer of small bales.
But all that has changed. It is raining as I write, and instead of Jim worrying
about the 4000 small bales we would have made in my day, the 60 tons of hay
is in big square bales, brought home ten to a trailer using a front loader, and
safely in the barn. And the only help Jim needed from me was a bit of tractor
driving. And I didn’t have to lift a thing.

August 11th
DEFRA’s Tea Party
Can anyone explain to me why compulsory set-aside is going to continue as part
of the newly reformed CAP? I thought we were being told to forget about production subsidies and concentrate on growing what the market and consumers
want. I can understand why set-aside was introduced. If farmers were being
paid so much an acre to grow corn, and too much corn was being produced, I
can easily visualise a bunch of Brussels bureaucrats sitting round a table into
the small hours deciding that, rather than reducing the money for growing corn,
they would pay the full amount for not growing corn. That way nobody was
disadvantaged – I am thinking here of the French – and there was the added
bonus of a new department to oversee how set-aside was regulated, with the
environmentalists cheering from the sidelines.
But that is now in the past. We are not being paid to grow corn anymore.
We can in future grow what we like or, providing we keep our land in good
farming condition, we don’t need to grow anything at all. So why has a set
percentage of our arable land still got to be put into set-aside? Why can’t we
even grow corn to feed to our own animals without this ridiculous constraint?
I know DEFRA would have preferred to end the compulsory basis, but was
overruled by the Commission. If set-aside has been such a wonderful benefit to
the environment, you would expect it to have been included in the voluntary
schemes for using our modulation funds. Judging by the amounts that are
being deducted from our single farm payments, there is every likelihood that
vast sums sloshing around will end up in some very non-agricultural pockets
before too many years are past.
Unfortunately that is not all of it. Having decided to continue the compulsory set-aside of arable land, the definition of arable land in the EC Regulations
has now been changed. I have been complaining for some time that farmland
which hasn’t seen a plough for five years will in future be called permanent pas195

2004
ture, and therefore from 2005 may not be ploughed up without prior approval.
I took the trouble to write to DEFRA explaining that there was such a thing
as rotational farming using long grass leys, but I can see why I never had an
acknowledgement. They already knew that any land that has been ploughed
in the last five years was to be defined as arable, including horticultural land,
land under greenhouses and ‘land under fixed or mobile cover’ (whatever that
is), and in future will have to be included in set-aside. How on earth does one
set aside a greenhouse? Or a cattle shed, if that’s what is meant by land under
fixed cover?
We’ve never had to worry here about ‘set-aside’ in the past, as the area of
corn we grow has never exceeded the ‘small producer threshold’. But that looks
all set to change. Jim has been thinking about ploughing up some of our long
leys this autumn to grow corn before reseeding back to grass, while we can still
to do so without permission. However, with our short leys now called arable,
this might force Jim to put some grass ground into set-aside for the next five
years, until it can once again be called permanent pasture. I really can’t see
what that will do for the environment. And leaving a field ungrazed and uncut
until September each year will not exactly improve the sward, merely make our
farming less extensive.
If that sounds complicated, try downloading their question-and-answer paper on the subject on DEFRA’s website. If you can understand it, you’re a
better man than I am. I ended up ringing their help line in Newcastle, but
they were unable to explain their fancy schemes that are not yet finalised and
are at present outside their remit. Before I was through, I began to feel like
Alice at the ‘mad hatters tea party’. I think Jim might be well advised to leave
ploughing till next year.
There are two other possibilities. According to DEFRA, if a holding is
entirely organic, it will for the first time be exempt from a set aside obligation.
I must get on the phone again and find out if that means we have to register
officially, paying some organisation £500 for the privilege, or whether some
inspector will visit the farm to see if we’re flinging fertilizer about when no
one is looking. Alternatively, if we can afford to, can we forget the single farm
payment, chuck all the regulations in the air and farm anyhow we wish? We are
being exhorted, after all, to look on the payment as a bonus and not produce
anything unless we can see a profit in it.

Is It Fair to Blame Farmers?

August 18th
Is It Fair to Blame Farmers?
Appreciable rain at last and we certainly needed it. Our pastures were beginning to dry up fast and it was looking increasingly likely that the four months
grazing, with which we hope to take the cattle and sheep through to the end
of November without additional feed, was not going to happen this year. By
cutting silage or hay fields only once and letting the aftermaths grow for eight
weeks before restocking, we can generally enjoy a fairly stress-free autumn, as
well as shortening the inevitable slog of winter chores. On our light land the
animals stay out until pretty late in the year, but wet weather on blackberry
grass is little use and damages the sward for next spring. This wet spell has
come just right and everywhere has greened up nicely. Even the very heavy rain
we had last Thursday was welcome, although neighbours with the odd field of
corn left to cut might not agree.
Nor can it have been much fun for the many people whose houses and
gardens were swamped by surface water flooding through villages in the region.
Watching that evening’s TV news, I felt very sorry for those who were mopping
up after seeing their furniture and belongings ruined by dirty water, but I admit
I was waiting for the usual comments made on these occasions. And sure enough
they were not long coming. First, that it’s the worst flooding in living memory
and, second, that it’s the result of modern farming.
It may be that for the individual village, this time Beer in East Devon, it
was the worst flood in living memory, but in my experience we get this kind of
weather somewhere almost every year. Who can forget the Lynmouth disaster?
I hadn’t been farming very long and I recall giving a lift to a woman in midDevon that day who had been to seek help and was returning to her flooded
mill house, where the water was half way up her ground floor. She asked me
to drop her off to save her wading back. She didn’t seem unduly upset, saying
it wasn’t the first time it had happened. I suppose it was only natural that
water mills would expect to be flooded from time to time, but nowadays whole
villages seem to be at risk.
There was a dreadful summer in the 1960s, when our hay rotted in the
fields for weeks. We were driving across Salisbury Plain to stay with relatives
and get away from it for a few days and we got caught in a cloudburst, with
mud and gravel spewing out of fields and gardens for miles, making the road
almost impassable. And now, as I write, we have news of the terrible events at
Boscastle.
Is it fair to immediately blame today’s farming methods? The assumption
197

2004
that farmland has only recently become unable to absorb heavy downpours
seems pretty farfetched. It’s true that our pastures with a good grass cover
would have held onto much of the two inches that fell this time, but they are
no different to fifty years ago, or even the pastures of 150 years ago. Before
that I can’t say, since there would have been no tile drainage, and stone drains
inevitably ran slower. But as always in very heavy rain, our narrow lane soon
becomes a river. However, there is one big difference now. Some years ago, the
Council put in a grating at a depression in the road, leading to a six-inch pipe
and thence to the stream. Before the lane was tarmac, there used to be a gap
through the hedge at that spot, which had to be regularly kept open by the
local length-men, as they were known, to deflect surface water to a ditch. The
road never flooded. The length-men are long gone and these days I have to get
to the grating fast to keep it clear of debris or the whole area overflows down
into our farm buildings.
I notice that most of our roads are now drained in this way. In the past,
surface water would have been run out onto farmland, and into ditches which
have largely disappeared. I seem to remember that the upkeep of these ditches
was also the responsibility of local Councils, and no doubt it is that expense
which has hastened their demise. Perhaps I am wrong, but is it possible that
modern road drainage rather than changes in farming has turned highways
to rivers in thunderstorms, with cars parked down village streets producing
bottlenecks and houses and gardens becoming inundated?

August 25th
Ambition Fulfilled at Last
I have finally achieved a lifelong ambition. Perhaps that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but I’ll explain. You often hear an old farmer begin a speech with
“today’s farmers have it easy - when I was a lad I had to hand milk the cows
and deliver it round the village on a bicycle before going to school”. Well, I did
hand milk cows for a few months when I first started and I have helped bottle
and deliver milk by six in the morning, albeit in a van. My claim to fame is
more on the lines that I’ve tried my hand at almost every job that has ever been
done on a farm. I’ve no doubt you could think up a few that I couldn’t have
done, such as threshing corn with a flail, but I have scattered the seed by hand
in the time honoured fashion and with a fiddle drill, reaped with a scythe and
tied the sheaves with the stalks of corn (only the headland before the binder
went in), made hay by hand (on tripods), and looked after most kinds of farm
animal.
198

Ambition Fulfilled at Last

The first farm I worked on was still using horses, although thanks to that
it was nearly the last. One of my first jobs was to take a quiet old horse to
fetch a hay rake from a field about a mile down the road. On the way back,
I steered too close to a heap of cordwood that was stacked on the verge and
managed to catch a protruding stick with one wheel, dragging the whole lot out
into the road behind me. The rumble of falling timber set the horse off at a
trot, which quickly changed to a gallop when I inadvertently grabbed the trip
mechanism and let the hay tines drop to the tarmac. Anyone who has used a
horse-rake will know there is nothing whatever to hold on to, to avoid being
pitched off the old-fashioned hard iron seat. The horse knew his way home all
right and somehow I stayed with him until we finished up in the middle of the
farm duck pond, having taken out one of the farmyard gateposts as we passed.
I was allowed to do some of the horse work after that, but my employer perhaps
wisely never let me loose with a plough. And horse ploughing was the one job
I never subsequently had a chance to try.
Last Sunday we went to the Annual ‘Working’ of the Western Counties
Heavy Horse Society at Powderham Castle. And what a grand day out it
was. The weather, contrary to the forecast, was fine, there was a good crowd,
the land was perfect for working, and the various breeds of Heavy Horse were
looking their splendid best. The theme for the day was ‘From Plough to Loaf’
– a farming year, with the complete sequence of farming operations needed to
take the seed corn to the fresh baked bread, each farm task demonstrated by
a different team of horses. For me, the highlight was a sail reaper dating from
the 1890s and in perfect working order, cutting a modern crop of wheat that
was probably twice as heavy as the machine was originally designed for.
It is often pointed out that in the old days using horses meant that the
power needed to produce food was also grown on the farm. I asked the owner
of the two magnificent Shires, which were pulling the plough, how many horses
would have been needed to work a 300-acre arable farm and how much land
would have been required to feed them. The answer was about nine, depending
on the soil type, and about 20 acres. Which makes me wonder why we aren’t
aiming to do the same today.
Research in Denmark shows that, on average, farms use about 100 litres of
diesel per hectare a year. One hectare of oilseed rape produces ten times that
amount of ‘cold pressed’ rapeseed oil which can substitute directly for diesel
after minor engine modification – unpolluting oil pressed in an inexpensive
plant with a low energy consumption. The whole process can take place on the
individual farm, with protein fodder cake as a by-product for animal feed. And
no fuel tax to pay or is that the snag? A much better way of using our set-aside
199

2004
or maybe I’m just a dreamer. Anyway I achieved my ambition. I was allowed
to plough a couple of furrows, although the horses knew more about it than I
did.

September 1st
Ignorance That Makes Me Furious
I really do see red when people use the troubles of farming to further their own
agendas. On the whole the public has been very supportive through the last
ten difficult years, and is becoming more so now that the emphasis on farm
support is changing to the care of the environment. This is clear from the many
letters to the press, which, while not always showing a complete understanding
of the agricultural industry, are very sympathetic to our current problems. I
am not an avid reader of the letters pages, but I do pick up on any that have a
farming headline. It is very heartening to see how many are from people outside
farming, and it doesn’t bother me if sometimes what they write isn’t strictly
accurate. At least they are taking an interest in matters rural and it is up to
us to correct any misunderstandings there may be about the workings of the
countryside. However all too often the writer appears to feel that all would be
well if we pulled out of Europe.
I am not very concerned with getting into a discussion here about the merits
or otherwise of our continuing membership of the EU. We all have our own
views about it, and are fully entitled to argue our case. What gets up my nose,
however, is the number of times the CAP is cited as the cause of all farming’s
troubles, using totally inaccurate statements to make the case. The reason for
my writing about it now is a particularly glaring example that appeared in the
letters page last Wednesday.
The writer, whom I won’t name, since I assume he is sympathetic to the
current problems facing dairy farmers, is obviously against our remaining in
Europe. His letter, headlined ‘CAP to blame’, opposes an earlier letter from
his local Lib Dem parliamentary candidate who quite correctly, in the opinion
of every dairy farmer I know, blames the present low milk price on the supermarkets. Unfortunately, in what reads like a little local spat between two
politicians, the truth about the dairy industry flies out of the window.
At the risk of boring you, I will labour each point the letter makes, since they
occur so often when people write criticising the CAP. Firstly – “French dairy
farmers are subsidised much more generously than their British counterparts
and have a much larger ‘quota’ which they don’t bother to keep to any way”.
That is of course complete rubbish. Even the inference that any European
200

Sep 8th

Farmer V Rook Gang

dairy farmer is directly subsidised is incorrect. The dairy support mechanism is
based on the intervention purchase price of butter and skim milk powder, and
is exactly the same Europe wide. And quota was based, when the system was
introduced, on the individual production of each and every European farmer.
The mechanism for operating quotas in the different member states may vary,
and we are fortunate in Britain in being able to buy and sell quota, which is
denied to French farmers. To suggest the French don’t pay a levy on over-quota
milk is ridiculous.
Secondly – “British farmers are only allowed by the CAP to produce 80% of
the country’s needs” and “being only allowed to work to 80% efficiency cannot
produce milk cheaply to compete with heavily subsidised French farmers”. Well,
we have never produced 100% of our milk needs. Our milk price has always
been heavily influenced by the retail price of fresh liquid milk, unlike continental
Europe where liquid milk is less important and mainly heat-treated. As a
nation, we have been happy to import cheap butter from New Zealand and
speciality cheeses and yoghurts from Europe. We could as well argue that we
might be better off producing only 75% of our requirements. Our individual
dairy herds are already among the largest in Europe. It is our processing and
marketing that needs to be more efficient.
Finally, the letter slams DEFRA for “adding to the misery by imposing huge
fines on those efficient farmers who do overproduce” and goes on to quote the
case of an individual farmer who will have no choice but to sell up and cease
farming in order to pay his fine. Well, of course DEFRA does not impose a fine
– it is a clearly defined European levy on over production to finance intervention
buying. Do we wish to revert to butter mountains, financed by the taxpayer,
with all the bad publicity that gave us? As for the individual farmer – he knew
the score. His overproduction merely reduced the price to the already struggling
within-quota producer. If he wanted to gamble on producing milk with too little
quota, that’s not efficient farming – he should have put his money on the horses.

September 8th
Farmer V Rook Gang
There are over 200 rooks busily searching for grubs among our cattle in the
7-acre. They’ve been there for over a week now, so obviously there’s sufficient
insect life to keep them happy, which speaks well of our green credentials. I’ve
counted them on a number of occasions using the old shepherds’ trick of counting
in threes or fours, and have easily reached 200 every time. I mention it because
I’ve hardly seen a rook all year on the farm. Plenty of jackdaws and crows, too
201

2004
many magpies, a few ravens and the odd jay, but scarcely a rook. So much so
that I have been half expecting to hear an anguished cry from the RSPB that
rooks are following sparrows into decline on farmland. Not that we are short of
sparrows here - we’ve had a very stable population of around 50 in and about
our farmyard for many years.
I realize why I have suddenly taken an interest in rook numbers this year
– it’s a form of ‘withdrawal symptoms’. Normally about now I find myself
stalking the blighters from dawn till dusk, as they descend in black hoards on
to any patch of laid corn while we anxiously await the arrival of the combine.
In a difficult season, with small inaccessible fields (it’s almost impossible to get
a combine down our lane), you can’t really blame our contractor if he rushes
on with the bigger farms first. The rooks somehow seem to know it, and target
our fields as soon as the corn reaches the milky stage, knowing they’ll have a
good long spell of easy feeding once they’ve sussed out the attack and escape
routes. We’ve plenty of woodland they can approach through and three sets
of power lines crossing the farm to perch along. And our badgers give them
their openings by flattening a few crop circles here and there in their nocturnal
wanderings.
We’ve tried everything in the past to keep the birds away; it is surprising
what a mess they can make in those last weeks before harvest. There was a
time when making the annual scarecrow was Jenny’s opportunity to force me
to dispense with the disgusting hat I’d been wearing for the previous twelve
months, and the holes beyond repair in my trousers and jacket were handy for
stuffing the body with straw. The snag with scarecrows is their lack of movement
and my effigy was generally used almost immediately as a rook lookout post.
Old sacks or polythene bags waving in the breeze were not much better and a
string of bangers in an old oil drum either fizzled out or went off in my face as I
looked in to see if it was still burning. A proper gas banger was more effective,
although our local rooks learned very quickly that the regular interval between
bangs might make them jump, but were otherwise harmless. They also seemed
to know that the neighbours would demand its immediate removable when I
forgot to switch it off at night.
In the end, in recent years, it came down to straight contest between the
rooks and me with a gun. A long shot with a .22 was pretty effective as they
were never quite sure where I was shooting from. A twelve-bore, however, using
both barrels, was the ultimate. A crafty stalk and then the sight of me leaping
up from behind a hedge and loosing off over their heads was good for a whole
day’s freedom from their marauding.
I have to admit it was a sort of love-hate relationship. Before anyone jumps

to the conclusion that I just enjoyed killing rooks, I should make it clear I took
a lot of trouble to miss - there were plenty more where they came from. The
challenge was to see if I could persuade the ringleaders to take their noisy mob
to some other farmer’s field for a change, and make it their first port of call in
the years to come.
Who knows, by growing no corn this year and having only swedes on the
arable ground, we may have succeeded in breaking their normal routine. I
wonder whose farm they ended up on. And are they grubbing around among
our cattle now just to remind me they haven’t forgotten where the best feeding
holes are, and they’ll be back next year to see if we’re growing corn again?

September 15th
Organic Benefits Beckon
For the last twelve months, Jim has been considering whether we should go
organic. As I think I have mentioned before, we are so nearly organic it seems
foolish not to go the whole hog if that’s what people are really prepared to pay
for. However, what has finally tipped the balance is not the possibility of making
more for our beef and lamb, but the stupid situation that has arisen over the
new Single Payment Scheme and the changes to the set aside rules that it has
introduced. To be forced to leave idle some of our best and most recently sown
grass leys for the whole of the summer, just because we wish to put some of our
older leys back into an arable rotation, is plain daft and anyone with an ounce
of commonsense at DEFRA should know it. I rang their helpline to confirm
my understanding of the information brochure that we recently received, but
although I read out chunks of the booklet to her, I couldn’t get their expert to
grasp what I was talking about. She gave me an email address to put my query
to, but I rang the NFU in Exeter instead who immediately confirmed my worst
fears.
So in order to continue farming in the way we always have, it seems we are
obliged to go organic, since for some reason unknown to me, organic farmers are
excused set-aside. Why should using 50 units of chalk-based nitrogen per acre
and worm dosing our cattle at weaning and our ewes at lambing as routine, force
us to take land out of production? I am sure there are many in the Westcountry
who farm traditionally as we do.
I know there are other farmers concerned about this, who are under the mistaken belief that they can waive the acreage part of the new payments and just
take the historic element and avoid cross compliance completely. Unfortunately
203

2004
it is all or nothing in England, although I believe the set-aside rules are not so
draconian in the other regions of the UK.
In view of our imminent application to the Soil Association, I took a special
interest in the series of articles in this paper celebrating Organics Week. Being unconvinced by the philosophy of the organic movement from my earliest
farming days, perhaps my interest was overly critical. I am a follower of the
great George Henderson, who wrote in 1943 in The Farming Ladder “While being great believers in natural manure and humus we do not condemn artificial
manures; they are useful for replacing the loss due to the sale of eggs, flesh and
bone in the stock sold off the farm, and the corn we are compelled to sell in
wartime”.
Carol Trewin, in the first article, certainly struck a good note with me when
she questioned the sense in burning vast quantities of non-renewable fuel to
import organic produce. I would go further and question the logic of saying that
using fossil fuel to grow organic food is all right, but using inorganic fertiliser
derived from fossil fuel is not. In our case, we may have to go back to shorter
rotations involving far more tractor work to generate the same production that
permanent pasture can deliver with a small quantity of bag nitrogen. We shall
see.
After that I thought the articles all went down hill somewhat. I have nothing
but admiration for organic farmers, as long as they don’t use their beliefs to
knock the rest of us. There was a quote in the second article from award winning
specialists in North Devon who claimed the market had improved thanks to the
help of “successful health scare stories”. I can accept that health scare stories
may have had an influence, but to be pleased they were successful is a bit much.
I suppose Mark Daniel’s piece last Thursday was the bottom. He was waxing
lyrical about a large organic farm that was aiming to be the biggest organic
estate in the country, producing some of the highest quality meat available.
Well, I wouldn’t know about all that, but I would question the quote made
by the owners “Sure you can undercut us, but your customers will be able to
taste the reason”. I can show you farms producing the best tasting beef I have
ever eaten and they are not organic. And if it’s happy cows you want, our
own stocking rate is less than half that of the organic farm Mark Daniel was
describing.

September 22nd
Is Global Warming True?
Are we really seeing global climate change? We are told that the ice caps
are melting and sea levels will rise to unimaginable levels, that the world will
experience increasingly turbulent weather and harvests will fail in the next
50 years, and about other dire consequences that will occur unless we take
immediate action to curb carbon emissions. And yet I have to say in all honesty
that, if it were not for the media, I wouldn’t have an inkling of the truth of all
that.
Here on this little farm in Devon, season has succeeded season with almost
monotonous regularity, spells of wet years followed by spells of dry years. We
have had one-off exceptional weather conditions - the great storm of 1987, the
drought of 1976, a blizzard in 1963, a flood in 1955. These were fairly shattering
events at the time for us, with 300year old trees dying one year, almost complete
failure of arable and forage crops another, our lane impassable with snow for
weeks, and our valley flooded six foot deep for one day with sudden snowmelt.
But they were all very (or relatively) local occurrences and I’ve never had the
impression that the weather was changing. I sometimes wish I’d kept detailed
records from when I started farming.
So how seriously do we have to take all the horror stories about the future?
There have certainly been some extraordinary climate changes in the past that
cannot be ascribed to human activity. A thousand years ago, if accounts of the
time are to be believed, southern Britain was better suited to growing vines
than much of France. This was followed by 500 years of increasingly colder
weather culminating in the ‘Little Ice Age’, with disastrous harvest failures –
millions of people in Western Europe dying of starvation in 1693 – and the
Thames in London, a tidal river, freezing so hard in the 1650s that frost fairs
were held on it with ox roasting for the masses. Imagine the headlines if that
happened today. Is the warming-up again part of a natural cycle caused by sun
spot activity or magnetic variation of the earth’s poles? Or is it our fault this
time with the burning of fossil fuel? We even help it on its way with untaxed
aviation fuel. And if we do nothing about it, is the process irreversible? Who
knows, but I tend to the theory that it is more likely the start of another ‘little
ice-age’, with warmer oceans eventually generating greater evaporation, cloud
cover and a colder world.
Meanwhile, we continue to use energy as if there was no tomorrow. Since
fossil fuel must eventually run out, and for the sake of the political troubles of the
world, the sooner we are less dependant on it the better. Here in the southwest,
205

2004
hardly a day goes by without proposed windfarms hitting the headlines. It seems
we either love them or hate them. I confess I don’t like the idea of hundreds of
wind turbines covering the Devon landscape, but sometimes as I travel down
the length of Cornwall, I admit to enjoying the sight of slow turning turbine
blades as they appear over the horizon near Pipers Pool. We are threatened
with 350ft high turbines not far from us here. If I object to them going up, will
my grand children one day object to them being taken down? What I want to
know now is the total cost of each one to make and erect, and exactly how much
electricity it will generate in the years ahead. Because although those figures
must be available, we never seem to get them in detail, the sort of detail that I
can relate to my electricity bill.

Futility of OTMS System
I have had the feeling all year that another chapter in the long history of British
farming was finally closing. We’ve known about it for some time, but only now
as the last pieces of the old farm support system are being sheared away, is it
really coming home to me.
We have a bunch of Angus-cross store steers, which we’ll be selling before
winter sets in, and I see that all of them will just qualify for their second subsidy
payment. Their retention period will not start until February next year - a little
used refinement of the rules not normally invoked, but invaluable in this the
final year of BSPS payments. It will make a difference of as much as £100 for
each of them, but it’s the last time steers from this farm will be carrying any
guaranteed support funding with them. In future they will only make exactly
what they are worth to the finisher. We are calving right now, ten calves in the
last week, but every bull calf born will have to do really well to show a profit –
there will be no money underpinning it as there has been in the past.
With heifer calves, the position is different. Except for the slaughter premium, there never was any money riding on them when they left the farm and
we tended to fatten most of them ourselves. In recent years they have in fact
qualified for suckler cow premium, which let us reduce our cow numbers without
losing our quota entitlement, but all that is nearly over as well. The best heifers
may join the breeding herd, but the remainder, like the steers, will be judged
at slaughter. However there is a possible change that could be very significant
in the case of the heifers that might be the make or break for suckler beef.
Last week Jim and I found ourselves taking a heifer all the way down to
St Merryn Meat, Bodmin, at very short notice, to get it slaughtered just three
206

Sep 29th

days before it reached the 30 months of age deadline. It was my fault, as the
farm clerk, for failing to check its birth date until nearly too late. It should
have been in-calf, but a last minute p.d. by the vet proved otherwise, and it
was a scramble to get it booked in. Not unexpectedly it was overfat on grading,
but it still made nearly twice as much as we would have received had we kept
it until this week, when it would have had to be incinerated under the OTMS
scheme, and paid for by the taxpayer. Its dam had already received one suckler
payment on its behalf, and it had itself received another suckler payment, both
payments also from the taxpayer.
A situation like that has never happened for us before, but it can easily
happen to anyone. OK, the suckler payments won’t be there in future, but the
nonsense of rushing perfectly good beef animals to slaughter for a matter of
three days is long overdue for change. The number of BSE cases in the national
herd is almost down to single figures, and cases in animals under five years old
don’t exist any more. All brain and spinal tissue is removed from every animal
going into the food chain and always will be in future. A BSE test at slaughter
is now available and is already used in other countries in Europe. A belt and
braces approach is fine whenever there is any doubt, but the OTMS belt is long
overdue for scrapping and replacing with the belt of a slaughter test.
Why would that make such a difference to us? Well, the heifer that caused us
a flurry would have been much better kept on the farm for another six months.
It would have made excellent beef slimmed down, would have reached a greater
weight at three years old, and would have cost the taxpayer nothing. In fact,
I calculate, the difference in its value would have been enough to replace the
suckler and slaughter premiums, which we will not be receiving in the years to
come. In effect it could have become profitable in its own right.
There would be one further advantage for suckler herds. I believe some of the
best beef comes from once-calved heifers. To be able to put most of our heifers
to the bull, give them another year of life on the farm replacing themselves as it
were, before going off to produce the real mature grass-fed beef of Old England
is exactly the opening of a new chapter that we all need just now.

Beef Event’s Success
We went last Wednesday to the Beef event at Hatherleigh and what a worthwhile
day out it proved to be. My congratulations to Bill Harper and the NBA South
West team for making it such a success. It was a pity Lord Haskins decided
to chicken out of attending, but in the circumstances any disruption could well
have spoilt what was a determined effort to put behind us all the troubles that
have bedevilled us in recent years. I doubt whether any political platitudes
would have added much to the occasion, but a few tart questions might have
livened up the main forum and sent him home with a flea in his ear.
My main reason for being there was to see the cattle. There were 14 breed
societies displaying superb examples of their pedigree animals, all crammed into
the store pens of the Hatherleigh Cattle Market. I doubt if so much variety of
beef genetics has been gathered in so small a space very often before. The
aisles between the pens were even more crowded with farmers like me, I hope
viewing the breeding possibilities for the future. The choice is becoming ever
more difficult with the bewildering number of beef breeds from which to pick
terminal sires for commercial suckler herds.
In the 15 short years since we gave up milk production and switched to a
herd of beef cattle, we have used five different breeds of beef bull, retaining a
few heifers each year for breeding. Hybrid-vigour has been the watchword and
an extremely mongrel herd of breeding animals is the result. Perhaps we are
the exception, but it is surprising how often one sees multi-coloured bunches
of suckler cattle in the countryside these days. Dairy cattle are uniformly the
black and white of the ubiquitous Holstein, with only the occasional browns of
the lesser dairy breeds.
We seem to have gone through two distinct phases with commercial beef
cattle since I started farming. In those days the majority of animals to be seen
in the north of the county were red ruby Devons, while in the south the much
larger creamy brown South Devons were almost totally dominant. What is
more, both breeds were dual-purpose. All around here there were herds of ten
or more Devons, tied up twice a day and hand-milked in shippens. South Devon
herds even qualified for premium contracts for the high quality of their milk.
The milk yields may not have been much to write home about, but the beef
from the pure bred steers was excellent, and the heifers were mostly retained as
replacements. Looking back, it seems like another age, but a very sustainable
way to farm. And there was never any doubt about what breed of bull to use.
Things changed very quickly over the succeeding years, with the spread of
208

YFCs Look to Future

Friesian dairy cattle into the southwest. It had a dramatic effect on the make
up of the new suckler herds, which hadn’t really existed before then, when
you didn’t keep a cow if you didn’t milk it. The best cross with a Friesian
cow for beef production, turned out to be a Hereford. I always believed it had
something to do with the richness of the yellow fat of a Hereford, almost too rich
to eat purebred, which matched the extreme whiteness, and tastelessness, of a
Friesian. Whatever the reason, the cross was a wonderful hybrid, which had the
advantage of instant recognition with its generally black body and inevitable
white face. And most importantly, it made a superb suckler cow. We still have
three of them in our herd now, but they are getting old and will be irreplaceable.
Times have changed again; Holsteins have taken over from Friesians, and a
plethora of continental breeds has produced a wealth of choice for the final beef
cross. But none of these make ideal suckler cows. Or if they do, I have yet to
notice an obvious cross that farmers are buying at store sales. However hope is
on the horizon, which takes me back to Hatherleigh. I was pleased to be able
to inspect a Stabiliser bull from what is claimed to be the new composite beef
breed of the future, a four-way cross that has been produced in North America
and New Zealand. It was a splendid animal, which looked something like an
oversized Devon, although I understand there are no Devon genes in Stabiliser
breeding and therefore a possible top cross for us here in North Devon? I was
also able to see how the new SWISH (South West Improved Suckler Half-bred)
project is progressing, with cattle from Bill Harper’s herd on show. It may well
be that the future of commercial suckler beef in the southwest lies in the success
of these breeding programmes.

October 13th
YFCs Look to Future
I have been lucky enough to attend a couple of Devon Young Farmers Club
events recently. I say ‘lucky’ because it allowed me to confirm my long held
belief that the pundits who say there is no future for British farming are quite
wrong.
I was invited to the first event to take part in a discussion on the new single
farm payments scheme, which was led by Neville Lane, the deputy head of
operations at DEFRA, Exeter. I wasn’t the only old fogey present, but I found
myself making all the wrong comments about the new scheme. I was harping
on about set-aside, permanent pasture restrictions and two metre strips, the
sort of things that just add to the red tape. The young farmers present were
far more concerned, and quite rightly so, about how they could establish right
209

2004
of possession for the land they were taking on as short term lets and grass keep.
The cross compliance rules they seem to take in their stride, as if that was all
part of modern farming. I must be careful I don’t start getting hidebound in
my old age.
There was one very important question raised by a young farmer, which
had to do with the historic part of his single payment entitlement. He pointed
out that, as a comparative new comer, using his figures for the years 2000 to
2003 had very little relevance to the stock numbers he was carrying now. The
two options available to him, under the rules, were to go back to previous years,
obviously ridiculous in his case, or try and claim under the new entrants reserve,
which seeing he was already farming might not be applicable. The rules for new
farmers do not appear to allow for 2004 to be taken into account at all.
If I have understood this correctly, then something urgently needs to be done
about it. It would be quite intolerable for young farmers just beginning their
farming careers to carry that level of handicap for the next five or six years.
Neville Lane promised he would pass on the question to London and I am sure
that the YFC will be making representations to the powers that be. I hope all
the farming organisations take it up as well. The last thing we need now is any
sort of deterrent to the next generation who are eager to grab what chances the
new payments scheme may offer.
The other YFC event I went to was a farm walk at Alan and Donna Webber’s
organic dairy farm at East Worlington, not very far from us. Since we have
decided to go organic ourselves, I was keen to see how grassland fared in the
change over from conventional to organic status on land similar to ours. Hensley
Farm has only been fully organic for just over three years, and yet the grass
production looks as good if not better than any farm in the district. Alan and
Donna were runners up in last year’s “South West Dairy Farm Business of the
Year” Competition and they are one of three finalists again this year. And
walking round their farm, I am not in the least surprised.
This time, I was the only old farmer present. What did surprise me as
we looked at the milking cows, whose numbers the Webbers are planning to
increase in the next two years, and the new 16/32 milking parlour currently
being installed, was the complete absence of any mention of Margaret Beckett
or the supermarkets in the conversation. Production figures and milk prices and
how the phasing out of production subsidies would affect farming were certainly
discussed, but those two subjects never came up. And what a pleasure that was.
I was grateful to Paul Gillbard, the chairman of the Devon YFC Agricultural
and Rural Affairs Committee, for letting me join the two events. It reminded me
of the first time I came into contact with Devon YFC on my arrival in Devon.

Sorry to Lose Fischler

I was one of a sheep shearing class, which was held on Paul’s farm, organised
by his grandfather. Or possibly his great grandfather, who was still alive at the
time. I joined our local club and for one year, before we were married, Jenny
and I were secretary and chairman respectively. I remember going round to all
the YFC dances that first winter in North Devon and what better way to get to
know the people I would be working among for the next fifty years. I see that
Witheridge YFC, which eventually absorbed our local club, is celebrating its
70th anniversary this month. Let’s hope it has at least 70 more years to come.

October 27th
Sorry to Lose Fischler
We have recently returned from a ten-day holiday, touring the western half of
the UK. One advantage of getting older is that our presence on the farm is no
longer really necessary, so the question of taking a holiday nowadays is not ‘if’
but ‘when’. As I think I’ve mentioned before, Jenny and I have always enjoyed
just throwing enough clothes in the back of the car and setting off without the
least idea where we would spend the night, or come to that, any of the nights
while the money lasted. We used to travel around Europe, but we’re becoming
less adventurous as the years go on, and we still have a few places in Britain
yet to visit. The rules we do try to follow, however, are to never sleep in the
same place twice or to drive along the same road twice. And to avoid using a
motorway wherever possible.
Without for one minute suggesting that this has any parallels with Cobbett’s
‘Rural Rides’, I find that viewing the countryside from a car can give some
impression about how farming is faring wherever we happen to be. Certainly
seeing things from the back of a horse would be better, but Cobbett might well
have been envious of our ability to cover nearly 2000 miles in the ten days.
On this occasion, once past Bristol we set off up through Wales following
the river Wye to within a mile of its source at Plynlimon. Welsh farming looks
in surprisingly good fettle. In the past, I have usually seen Wales as slightly
poor relation to us here in the South West, but not on this trip. I can’t exactly
put my finger on it, but farming everywhere looked pretty prosperous. Is it
the result of their having a Welsh Assembly, and therefore there own farming
minister, or are they receiving extra financial support from Brussels? Perhaps
it is even simpler than that – all the hedgerows without exception in Wales
seem to be trimmed with a rounded top, instead of the usual flat and rather
ugly top seen everywhere else. It must mean extra passes to achieve the result,
which does imply a more leisurely and therefore affluent approach to farming.
211

2004
The Royal Welsh Showground at Builth Wells was on our route and I recalled
the last time I’d been there. Richard Haddock and I had travelled up and stayed
overnight about six years ago, in the hope of speaking to Franz Fischler, the
EU Agriculture Commissioner, who was attending a meeting there for Welsh
farmers. We were very anxious to get his support to overturn the iniquitous
weight limit on OTMS cattle that had been introduced by our own minister,
Jack Cunningham, when Labour first came to power.
We were able to speak with him privately, although without success for our
case, which was outside his jurisdiction. But for once at least when talking to a
politician with that level of authority over our industry, I found myself talking
to a fellow farmer. And what a lot of time that saves. I have often seen Franz
Fischler in action at farmer meetings since and, unlike some politicians I could
mention, he has never been afraid to meet grass-roots farmers head on. His
time as commissioner ends in a few days, and I for one shall be sorry to see
him go. I think history will treat him kindly in what must at times have been
a thankless task. If he has managed to start the process of getting European
farmers out of the subsidy mentality, he might even be credited with performing
a near miracle.
His successor, Mariann Fischer Boel, who also comes from a farming background, seems to have had a rough ride at her audition with the European parliament’s agricultural committee, where she was described as vague and weak,
and told to be more aggressive in future. I just hope she avoids the easy option
of re-nationalising farm policy every time she hits a problem. I sometimes daydream about where UK farming would be had we not joined the EU 30 years
ago. I am one of those who firmly believe that by now there wouldn’t be much
of our agriculture left.
Our holiday took us on up through Snowdonia and the Lake District, to
the Scottish Highlands. We returned through Edinburgh, and stopped off long
enough to have a conducted tour of their new parliament building. It was a very
sore subject with any Scot we mentioned it to out in the sticks, particularly
the cost. On close inspection they have a point. The building had a lot of
stick-like metal rods attached aimlessly to the outside, giving it a very strange
appearance. A rook’s nest springs immediately to mind, whether because I’ve
read it somewhere, or because the collective word for a gathering of rooks is
a ‘parliament’. The inside wasn’t much better – more like a glorified county
council building with too much plain concrete in evidence. Beware the expense
of regional assemblies.
We came on home through the Scottish Borders and down the Pennines.
Sheep numbers everywhere we went looked very healthy, but there were fewer

cattle to be seen than in the past; maybe the wet weather has brought them
in for the winter earlier than usual. I hope that’s all it is – there is a huge
potential for extensive beef production in all our uplands, which it would be a
national disgrace to allow to fade away.

November 3rd
November Ground Is in a Soggy State
I am only just recovering from a totally surprise ‘bash’, which the family organised last Friday to celebrate our 50 years of trouble and strife - Jenny’s
description, not mine. As you would expect, with friends and relatives gathered
from all parts, the get-together continued through Saturday, and for once in my
life I actually welcomed that gloomy harbinger of winter: the extra hour in bed
on Sunday morning.
So now, after holidays and party, it’s back to earth with a bump, or rather,
after all the October rain, with a squelch. And what a soggy state the ground
is in. For the first time this year the field drains are running full bore and the
streams bank high. The water table on this farm has been very low for a long
time; it’s been a real problem driving in fence posts in some fields, as our fencing
contractor would readily agree. The soaking we’ve had, coming at this time of
year, will hopefully, for the 10 thousand young oak and ash trees Jim planted
five years ago, last through to next spring. The down side is that any chance
of keeping the cattle outside till Christmas is receding; they’re much happier
out, especially the suckling calves. We have plenty of grass and where there’s
any lack of fibre, we’re feeding hay loose in the fields. Any slight poaching that
may occur seems to be repaired by the reseeding effect of grass-seed shed from
the hay. With no more than 30 cattle in a group, and three or four fields plus
woodland available to each group, we are still hoping to stretch the autumn for
another month at least.
On the arable side, the weather has beaten us. Jim had been intending to
return the thirty acres, which for this year had been rented to the May Farming
Partnership for swedes, back to winter barley and oats, or possibly if we were
delayed to try triticale for the first time. In the event, although there were
a few days after the swedes were harvested before the rain came down, the
opportunity slipped by and the ground will have a second crop-free winter, and
be planted to barley, possibly undersown, next spring.
The swede harvesting appeared to go without a hitch, although Peter May
might say otherwise. The netlon, which had covered the swedes all summer,
was neatly rolled up mechanically with a farm-designed tractor attachment,
213

2004
ready for reuse next year. The 700 or more tons of swedes were lifted and
boxed by one chap operating a swede harvester and taken away by tractor and
trailer, presumably to be washed, graded and packed. The whole operation
took little more than a week, and to my surprise I never saw more than four
people in action at any one time, and not a swede touched by hand. In fact, if
I hadn’t heard the tractors going over the hill, I might have missed seeing them
altogether.
By now I imagine those same Devon swedes will have been sold in retail
outlets in every city in the UK. Without the sophisticated distribution of the
supermarkets, how else could our local swedes have reached so quickly the dinner
tables of countless homes from John O’Groats to Lands End? And yet, every
time I open a farming paper nowadays, I am sure to find an article or letter
attacking with venom the trading methods, environmental credentials, or even
the morals of supermarkets in particular and in general. All right, no doubt
some of the criticism is justified, but does any farmer really wish they were
never invented.
One aspect of this controversy has been getting extra coverage lately. It is
the suggestion that government should bring in legislation to stop supermarkets selling food below the cost of production or alternatively to set producer
contracts at or above the cost of production. Now in view of the problem we
had some months ago in finding where 20p of the liquid milk price had disappeared to, how on earth are we going to arrive at an accurate producer price
for any farm product? And do we really want to push our prices down to the
lowest common denominator? Unless the supermarkets were denied the right
to import food at that minimum price, and what government would stomach
that, surely we would just be hastening the export of our agricultural industry.

Morley Knows Better
Hardly a week goes by without an item in the news about the latest figures for
wild bird populations. It normally takes the form of a hand-wringing exercise
by a national or international bird society, bewailing the decline of one or more
species considered vital indicators to the well being of the planet.
This week it is European bird numbers that are in the firing line, which
makes a change from just our British birds hogging the headlines. And quite
right too. There is not much point in safeguarding our small patch of the environment when so many of the birds we all enjoy are migratory, travelling back
and forth each year from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe or Africa. According to

Birdlife International, nearly half of Europe’s bird species are in serious decline,
with some so threatened they may disappear altogether. Is this scare mongering or a real rallying call for action? Or, were I to be really cynical, just a
bit of hype to boost support for the various bird charities? Because, lets face
it, bird numbers all over the world are declining, as are virtually every species
of animal with one obvious exception. And it’s the one obvious exception, the
rapidly expanding human population, which is the real problem.
Please don’t get me wrong; I am not just having a go at the RSPB. I have
the greatest admiration for the work it does in boosting the pleasure we all get
from our birdlife. I am not a member of the Society myself, but many of my
best friends are, and I am not about to put that friendship in jeopardy. But as
a farmer, this is one of those times when I really feel I must stand up for myself.
I have to ask, therefore, why on this occasion does Mark Avery, the conservation director at the RSPB, comment on the report by saying “Unfortunately,
losing our farmland bird population is an area where the UK excels in Europe.
The great danger is that we will now export intensive agriculture to eastern
Europe, destroying their wildlife too”. With all the work the RSPB has done
in recent years in changing the attitude of farmers to conservation, a real success story that is obvious in the pages of every farming magazine or newspaper
supplement, why does Mr Avery need to make such a crass statement? It is
guaranteed to inflame the feelings of any farmer already wondering who had the
most say in some of the cross compliance regulations for the new single farm
payments – DEFRA or the RSPB. I see that the RSPB has immediately deplored the relaxation of the two-metre hedgerow rule for small fields – the very
fields that already do most for bird life. And it is suggesting a tightening up of
the times of year when hedges can be trimmed, already restricted solely for the
benefit of birdlife, with scant regard for the trees and shrubs which comprise
their make up.
At the very least, Mr Avery could have highlighted everything we are trying
to do in this country to marry food production with conservation, and encourage
eastern European farming to follow suit. Agriculture in the newly joined member states will intensify, whatever Mr Avery may hope. Unfortunately, he is not
the only person to use an opportunity like this to knock farmers, when precisely
the opposite approach is needed. Elliot Morley recently made the remark that
intensive dairy farming has “the biodiversity capacity of green concrete”, when
commenting on wild bird numbers.
As a junior DEFRA minister, in fact the only one who has survived since
Labour came to power 7 years ago, he knows better, as I am well aware from
accompanying him on a daylong tour of Devon farms when he was responsible
215

2004
for animal health. In fact of all the DEFRA ministers we have suffered during
this government, with his self-professed interest in bird watching he is probably
the only one from whom I might have expected a constructive observation.
What he said sounds like a throw away line to an audience of ‘twitchers’, who
would have had the sense to treat it as a joke. Would Mr Morley have the nerve,
I wonder, to tell a gardening club audience that the roughly half a million acres
of lawn in the UK use more global-warming energy to maintain them, with
less benefit for bird life, than any comparable area of open land, farmed or
otherwise? I doubt it – he has the voters to think about.

Problem of New System
If ever we take a holiday in Scotland again, I must be very careful not to light up
a cigarette with my coffee after enjoying an Angus steak in a Scottish restaurant.
I might very well find the long arm of the law tapping me on the shoulder, with
the suggestion that I spend the night in a cell. Not that I’m that bothered
about the Scots being permitted to curtail my civil rights as a UK citizen; I
haven’t smoked since my student days and if passive smoking is killing off too
many north of the border, I suppose Scotland has the right to do something
about it. It has its own parliament, after all.
I might very well be a bit miffed, however, if I owned a Scottish pub a few
miles from the English border, and found all my smoking customers deserting
me in droves. What has all this to do with farming you may well be wondering.
The answer lies in the Angus steak. From next year, thanks to another decision
in Scotland, I shall be reflecting on the fact that my Scottish beef-producing
counterpart is receiving more per acre under the new Single Farm Payments
Scheme than we are. He will continue to get his full historic entitlement for all
the years the scheme exists, whereas we will increasingly be sharing ours with
anyone who owns a few acres of farmable land.
Don’t get me wrong; I don’t want to seem dog-in-the-manger about this. If
some chap with just a couple of ponies for his kids is prepared to keep his land
in good farming condition against a possible world famine, and agrees to leave
a two meter margin round a field he never touches, and to cut at set times of
the year the hedge he never trims, I suppose he deserves a share of our historic
entitlement. I find it a little harder to swallow sharing it with a newcomer to
the countryside, who merely wants to live in splendid seclusion keeping as many
acres as possible between himself and the common masses.

Problem of New System

Farmers that have never in the past received production subsidies will now
progressively be entitled to payments, ostensibly for land management. They
are in an altogether different category, and although I certainly grumble about
it, I don’t see it as sharing; rather an overdue gradual transition to a fairer
system of rural support.
But that doesn’t quite square with the fact that my beef-producing friend
in Scotland will, by 2011, be putting a steak on a plate with about twice the
rural support that we will be getting in England, and possibly be doing less in
the way of environmental work. I know all the financial experts and leaders of
our industry are exhorting us not to see this payment as a subsidy to continue
farming at a loss. And nor should we, but in the short term that is not as easy
for many of us as it sounds. For a start, we have all invested in our farms over
the years with buildings and machinery, most of which has many years to run
and may well be in hock to banks or hire purchase firms. We ourselves are in
urgent need of a new cattle-crush. Do we struggle on with the old one, which is
hardly up to welfare standards, or do we go out and spend £1000, and then flog
it at a loss if we end up ceasing beef production next year. For dairy farmers,
this dilemma is even more critical.
The correct answer must surely be to use the new payments as a cushion for
the first few years and see how things go. And in that sense, farmers in Scotland
(and also in Wales), who produce milk, beef, sheep or arable crops have a very
real advantage over similar farmers in England. A fine level-playing field that
turns out to be! And strange as it may seem, in the case of the potato and swede
I enjoy with that hypothetical Angus steak, exactly the reverse occurs. They
may well be grown by equally frustrated Scots, competing (or giving up) with
no support at all against well-supported English swede and potato growers. If
that is the result of regional decision-making, thank goodness the North East
gave Prescott a bloody nose over his regional assembly idea. We have enough
trouble trying to maintain fair competition across Europe, without adding to it
within the UK.
It’s ironic that the Chancellor is this week trying to persuade his colleagues
in Brussels that British firms are suffering severe problems in obtaining public
service contracts across Europe, thanks to the shenanigans of individual countries bending the rules to their own national advantage. Margaret Beckett has
obviously never had a word in his ear.

November 24th
Training Days for DEFRA
”That was the week that was – its over, let it go”. The words of the song that
opened the satirical TV programme in the 1960s sprang to mind as I listened
to the extraordinary statement with which the Speaker of the Commons closed
the Hunting debate last Thursday evening, before invoking the Parliament Act.
The actual wording of the message from the Lords was such gibberish that it was
not surprising he followed it by saying that he reads these messages but doesn’t
understand them. Some of the speeches in the debates in both Houses, which
I also listened to that afternoon, also showed a singular lack of understanding
on both sides. Last week may be over, but it certainly doesn’t look like going
away.
I find it very unfortunate that it appears to be polarising town and country
once again, after all the efforts that are being made to foster more understanding
about how the countryside works. I happen to be against hunting, and I know
plenty of farmers who feel as I do. I also know many towns’ folk who are pro
hunting and would wish it to continue. It is not a simple town versus countryside
issue, but I fear the headlines will continue to make it so for some time yet.
As farmers, there is another area where we regularly bemoan the lack of
understanding of those with no mud on their boots. How often have I heard the
complaint that DEFRA inflicts us with regulations, without having the least
idea of how they will actually affect us down on the farm? For most of us,
complaining is as far as it goes, but I am happy to write about two farmers in
our parish who have actually done something about it.
For the last three years, David Grant, a sheep farmer with some suckler cattle
and arable land, and Frank Yendell, our neighbouring dairy farmer, have been
running what can best be described as a series of training days for members of
staff from DEFRA’s RPA office in Exeter. It seems it all started with a simple
comment by a DEFRA official at a farmer meeting, suggesting that farmers
could help speed up some of the ministry paperwork, if queries from Exeter
were answered by return of post. David apparently got to his feet and asked
if DEFRA staff really understood how a farmer in the middle of lambing dealt
with a two-page questionnaire. And amazingly, it all developed from there.
Since 2002, David and Frank have been arranging sessions for RPA staff
to come out to our parish and see at first hand how life goes on down on the
farm, with particular reference to those regulations with which the staff were
actively involved. In the first year, they organised three visits at fortnightly
intervals, looking at dairy farming and the effect of milk quotas. The following
218

Dec 1st

Lottery of New Crops

year, IACS regulations and farm crops were the subjects covered, and after that
three sessions on beef and sheep.
Each training day starts with 15 RPA staff arriving at about 10 o’clock at
our local pub, for an informal presentation by Frank and David, lasting about
an hour and a half, on the subject to be covered by the farm visits that day.
A morning farm walk is followed by lunch back at the pub, with an afternoon
visit to a different farm. Stephen Jeffery, another local dairy and beef farmer,
provides an alternative venue to ring the changes.
I understand the numbers are restricted to about 15 on each occasion to
be sure every one present can be individually talked to. With different people
attending each time and 12 training days now completed, David and Frank
must have got through to many of the staff in the Exeter office exactly what
the paper work looks like from our side of the fence. I really take my hat off
to both of them. Perhaps it’s happening all over the southwest, but it’s the
only instance I am aware of. What I really like about it is that it’s not an NFU
or other official farming organisation doing it, it is being undertaken by two
practical farmers who know what being strangled by red tape feels like.
Their subject for this year has been ‘Agricultural Awareness’, with the emphasis on how the Single Farm Payment will affect farming in the future. What
a pity Margaret Beckett, Alun Michael, old uncle Lord Whitty and all haven’t
been here this year. They might have benefited more than local DEFRA staff.

December 1st
Lottery of New Crops
Unexpectedly and rather late, we’ve drilled our triticale. I mentioned in this
column a month ago that the opportunity to plant any winter corn this year
seemed to have slipped by, thanks to the very wet state of the ground. Even
the hope of getting in one field with the wheat/rye hybrid, to spread the work
of tilling and harvesting next year, looked to have gone. But the few dry days
last week encouraged Jim to see if our contractors were free to give it a go. And
to my surprise, last Friday saw a 16-acre field ploughed and drilled in the day.
Alan Isaac reckoned it had gone in better than much of the corn he drilled in
October. Modern machinery certainly makes a difference.
Having never grown triticale before, I shall be very interested to see how
it does. The grain is apparently suitable for cattle feed, unlike wheat or rye
alone. I remember being encouraged to give it a try in the 1970s by a farmer
who had gone in for it in quite a big way in North Devon. He reckoned it was
219

2004
the answer to all our livestock bedding problems, which necessitated bringing
countless lorry loads of straw from the Eastern counties every autumn. As so
often happens in farming, a slight twist in the way we do things reduced the
need for straw almost overnight - a Welsh dairy farmer invented cow cubicles.
Novel crops and livestock always generate a great deal of interest when they
first hit the agricultural headlines, especially when farming fortunes are going
through the doldrums. I recall a small dairy-farming neighbour trying intensive
rabbit production, which was a short-lived craze in the 1960s. He certainly made
no money at it, but the firm selling the cages and breeding stock undoubtedly
did very well. The same thing happened recently with ostrich farming. That
was going to be the meat of the future, healthier, tastier and every bit of the
bird could be used to good purpose – never mind the kick of an adult male
that could kill a man. We had a local NFU farm walk at the time, round what
looked like a very flourishing ostrich farm not five miles away; but it has all
gone now, and the land is back to normal Devon farming.
New crops do seem to have a better track record; perhaps it is easier to breed
plant varieties to suit different environments. Maize is a very good example.
Although I saw it grown in the 1940s for feeding green to cattle in the autumn,
very much as marrow stem kale was used, it really took off once we had the
varieties which cobbed up sufficiently to make high dry matter silage. We grew
it here from the early 1970s until we gave up dairy farming, and on our dry
land we were very glad of it.
Another new crop, which is currently giving local farmers food for thought is
miscanthus. Energy for thought might be a more accurate way of putting it, as
a plant for food production it is not. On the face of it, the potential for energy
production does looks enormous, about as enormous as the plant when fully
grown - it’s not called ‘miscanthus x giganteus’ for nothing. Once the crop is
established, it can produce as much as six tons per acre of combustible material
per year for very little, if any, inputs. That sounds very promising, but it takes
a minimum of five years to reach that yield. And the planting costs are nearly
as gigantic as the crop – at least £400 an acre, after government grant. At
present, if a guaranteed contract were available, with the maximum annual net
return after five years expected to be about £60 per acre, it would take eight
years to recoup the establishment costs.
If I sound pessimistic, you may be wondering why the sudden interest. Well,
there is a proposal from a local firm, Peninsula Power, to build a biomass power
station at Winkleigh, with the intention of making miscanthus the majority of
the plant material required to fuel it. Which is where we local farmers come in
– without us no power station.

Lore of the Versatile Goose

So last week I trotted along to Winkleigh Village Hall to hear all about it. I
shouldn’t have bothered. The local people of Winkleigh are so incensed by the
idea that it was standing room only, and by midnight any farming considerations
hadn’t begun to be questioned. What I wanted answered first is why build
what is basically an agricultural power station in a village, with the inevitable
and justifiable backlash from the inhabitants. Why not build it out in the
countryside on a large farm?

December 8th
Lore of the Versatile Goose
Christmas is coming and the goose we’ve ordered is hopefully getting fat. What
the pennies and the old man’s hat in the nursery rhyme refer to I’ve no idea.
I believe most nursery rhymes originated in some political scandal of the day,
but I’ve never heard the origin of this one. I must ask John Burns, who I’m
sure will know the answer, when I go and fetch our bird from him.
John, a long time friend of mine, retired earlier this year after 25 years as the
southwest correspondent of the Farmers Weekly. He has been a very familiar
and popular figure to all of us in the region. I hope one of these days he will sit
down and write a book about some of the events he reported on with what I
suspect at the time was a fair degree of tactful diplomacy. It would make very
lively reading.
However, it may be a while coming. John has always, since I’ve known him,
farmed a little on the side, and now that he’s given up full-time journalism,
instead of taking life easier he seems to be plunging in with both feet. He has
gone in for breeding and fattening geese for the Christmas market on his fifty
acres at Burrington. Not a job for the faint hearted, but I have a hunch he’s
backing a winner. Goose seems deservedly be regaining its popularity as the
traditional dish for Christmas.
We tend to forget how important geese were to England in the past. I know
wool was reckoned to be the basis for England’s prosperity in the middle ages –
hence the ‘woolsack’ in the House of Lords, although maybe for not much longer
- but geese have also certainly figured in much of our history. The Magna Carta,
the Works of Shakespeare all written with a quill pen, the flight feather of a
goose cut to shape, a left wing feather if you were right handed, because the
feather curves the other way, and you compensated by the direction in which
you wrote. The quill was trimmed every ten lines or so with a penknife, which
has me wondering how many flight feathers were needed down the ages. And
not just for making quills. The arrows used by our longbow men at the battle
221

2004
of Agincourt were fletched with goose quills. Talk about farmers diversifying
today; we seem to have been diversifying for as long as we’ve been farming.
You may be wondering why my sudden interest in all this. I happened to
look up ‘geese management’ in a thousand-page tome, Practical Agriculture
by R.W.Dickson, published in 1805, lent me by a friend in case I ran out of
subjects to write about, and I came across something that completely surprised
me. Apparently geese used to be farmed as much for their feathers as for food. I
know goose feathers have always been used for pillows and mattresses, but I was
not aware that the birds were actually kept for plucking alive at regular intervals
through the year, in the same way as sheep were bred for wool production.
According to Dickson, plucking began in April, and with good feeding, breast
and back feathers could be plucked up to five times a year. When fed with barley
and oats, the feathers grew faster and were better in quality than where it was
omitted. The quill feathers, five from each wing at a time, could be taken up to
four times a year, and these sold for five shillings a thousand, not a bad price for
those days. Elizabethan playwrights must have been very popular with farmers.
Geese used to be a very common bird on most farms until recently, but I would
like to know when live plucking died out; I don’t recall learning about it in my
student days. Plucking the Christmas goose was always the one job that arose
when something else urgently needed doing.
I doubt if goose feathers figure very much in John’s calculations on profitability, although I presume they have a value. And I’m sure mechanical plucking
will be the order of the day, when the time comes. All this is something else I
must ask him about: my agricultural education with respect to geese is obviously sadly lacking.

December 15th
Brave Choice Speaker
Like them or loathe them, it is surprising to learn that they actually hate each
other. No, not politicians; I’m talking about the supermarkets chains. I always
assumed that the big four, as they are known – Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and
Sainsbury’s - were ruled by men with hearts of stone and a steely eye for the
bottom line, and no emotions worth writing about. But Clive Beddall, speaking
at the Devon NFU AGM in Exeter last week, assured us that in reality they
felt so strongly about each other that, given half a chance, their greatest delight
was in trying to put one another out of business. And Clive is probably the
best-qualified man in the UK when it comes to a discussion about supermarkets.
He worked for The Grocer magazine for nearly 40 years and was editor-in-chief
222

Dec 15th

Brave Choice Speaker

for ten years until retirement. He now runs his own food and media consultancy
and is a regular speaker on food matters throughout Europe.
It was a brave choice of speaker. Normally with a general election in the
offing, it has been customary for the NFU to invite the opposition agricultural
spokesman to come along and promise farmers untold wealth, a reduction in
red tape, and good weather to boot, providing we helped remove the incumbent
administration. I have noticed that on the odd occasion this has come to pass,
the said opposition spokesman has surfaced in the new government with a quite
different portfolio, where any rash pledge can be swiftly denied.
Not this time. The NFU put its faith in a speaker to back up where its
mouth has been all summer: the future is in the market place. Once the
single farm payment scheme is safely bedded down by May next year, political
interference will hopefully have less and less bearing on our day-to-day lives.
Cheques coming out of the Rural Payments Agency should be put in a pension
fund or the lottery. If it doesn’t pay to produce food, don’t. If it does pay,
much of the reward will be coming through, or should I say filtering down to
us from the supermarkets. And the NFU got it right – we had a full house and
a good meeting.
I suspect the outgoing Devon chairman, Martin Hann, was responsible for
getting Clive Beddall along. It is very strange how often Devon county chairmen
fit into the role that circumstances dictate. As members, we can’t know what
the future holds, and yet the chairmen we choose, a couple of years in advance,
generally seem to be well suited to the trials and tribulations they end up facing.
Martin Hann’s year has bridged the production-subsidy past and the marketplace future. And, if you can believe it, Martin has been the only chairman
I can remember who never had a production subsidy in his life. He’s a pig
producer. He hardly knows what the initials by which the rest of us recognise
these subsidies stand for. And he hasn’t had to learn. But he certainly knows
how to earn a living from the market place. What better chairman could we
have had this particular year?
With that in mind, I am trying to forecast what lies ahead. Leyland Branfield is the chairman for 2005. He is already familiar to many of us in Devon
from the black days of foot-and-mouth. I know him well enough to be sure
he will forgive me if I say he is not a man to stand on ceremony. He turned
up to last year’s AGM late, but in time to be elected deputy-chairman. He
came straight from a TB herd test on his Dartmoor farm still dressed in his
working clothes (but minus his overalls I hasten to add). Every cattle farmer
knows what state working clothes are in after that little chore, but it didn’t faze
223

2004
Leyland one jot. He was more suitably dressed this time, but he’s just the man
for me.
And what did we learn from Clive Beddall about the future? It was clear
from his analysis of the grocery business that the supermarkets, particularly
the big four, will be holding on to their share of the nations spending. In
fact, Clive hinted that he would not be surprised to see Sainsbury’s falling to a
takeover bid, and with Morrisons relatively weak in the south, we are stuck with
Asda and Tesco. They are both huge multinational companies with no special
patriotic feelings for UK farmers. There were more British buyers present at
SIAL in Paris this October than he had seen in the past, anticipating the effect
of the new farm support system. To stay in business, we have to sell ourselves
as a national brand. And here the good news is that national flags may soon
be allowed on food labelling.

December 22nd
First Find Your Farm
22nd Dec ’04 First find your farm
I scrambled out of the passenger seat and slid a brick under the back wheel
of the Riley. It was midday on a Friday in the middle of July 1951. I can
remember it as if it were yesterday. It was the first time I set foot on Devon
soil – or tarmac to be precise. We were half way up Fore Street on our way
into Exeter and John was worried that our dynamo appeared to have packed
up. He had spotted a garage on the other side of the road and being reluctant
to switch off the engine, left me to ensure the handbrake didn’t fail while he
made some enquires about replacement dynamos.
John’s car was a 1933 Riley that he had owned since his RAF days before
he went up to Cambridge, which is where I got to know him. We both read
Agriculture and had shared ‘digs’ for a year, which cemented what was to
become a lifelong friendship. On the advice of our tutors on the inevitable
escalation in land values following the 1947 Agriculture Act, we had decided to
pool what money we could muster from our respective families and see if we
could get a foot on the farming ladder as soon as we had completed our final
year. The Westcountry or South Wales were suggested as likely areas to find
an affordable farm.
So here we were on a very hot day in July, about to spend ten days driving
round Devon armed with a sheaf of about 40 for-sale particulars of farms in
the county. John had driven down from Leicester the day before to pick me
up from near Guildford in Surrey, where I was living with my parents. We set
224

Dec 22nd

First Find Your Farm

off very early in the morning, hoping to reach Exeter by lunchtime and get our
bearings and some advice on how to plan our trip, since we were both strangers
to Devon. We were not exactly flush for cash, three years at university were as
draining on resources as they are today, and our idea was to camp out and find
some work potato picking in between looking at farms.
We made good time to Exeter. The Riley, which could be temperamental,
seemed to be running sweetly when we’d stopped at Stonehenge, which neither
of us had seen before. Stonehenge wasn’t what it is today. We’d parked beside
the empty A303, and walked across the down-land, stepping over some rusty
barbed wire, to stand among the ancient stones. There wasn’t a soul in sight
and the larks were singing in a clear blue sky. We had the feeling we were on
our way. But it didn’t last - before reaching Devon, a little red light on the
dash had started indicating trouble.
John came back with directions to a garage likely to sort us out, which
was located in the centre of the city. We went on and parked in what was a
wasteland of bombsites – not what I’d expected at all. And the news about the
dynamo was even more depressing. There was nowhere in Exeter that would
have a replacement. Without a car, our hopes of finding a farm were dashed.
It was rather a special car for John. He had cherished it for many years
and was certainly not about to abandon it now. It had a fluid flywheel with
pre-selecting gears, and the tendency to produce smoke around the back seats
when cornering too fast, much to the alarm of backseat passengers. Toad of
Toad Hall would have thoroughly enjoyed driving it. Its other peculiarity was
the dynamo which was direct-driven, bolted in line onto the main drive-shaft. It
was not something easily replaced and would almost certainly need rewinding.
We decided to return to Surrey and hope that, by not stopping, there might
be enough left in the battery to see us home before dark. Passing a deserted
Stonehenge for a second time, our spirits were now as low as the skylarks that
had retired for the night. John was working out how to get back to Leicester
the following day.
Fate has some funny ways. Saturday morning and my local village garage
sent us into Guildford to a little back street workshop, which rewired dynamos.
There we found the exact replacement, the only one the electrician had ever
seen before, which he had just finished rewinding and which he was happy to
swap. We spent the weekend at home safely under a roof while the most violent
thunderstorms of the summer broke out all over southern England. On Monday
morning we set off again to find our farm.

225

2004

December 29th
We Find Our First Holding
29th Dec ’04 We find our first holding
By Monday, the weekend thunderstorms had passed and John and I set
off once more to find a farm in Devon. The oppressive heat of the previous
week was gone, and with it the gloom that had overtaken us on our long drive
back from Exeter the previous Friday. We really hadn’t expected to find a
replacement dynamo, and as we only had that one ten-day opportunity, I think
we’d subconsciously given up any hope of our dream farm. But it was another
day, and although we might not be able to view as many farms as we’d intended,
we weren’t about to give up.
As we motored westward, John decided to throw caution to the winds and
satisfy a long held ambition. He’d always wanted to see if the Riley was capable
of climbing Porlock Hill. It was apparently some kind of car virility test, and
by now we were in that sort of mood. So it was forget Exeter and head for
Minehead, where we found a cafe and had our meal for the day. Eating out
was a problem in those days; it’s easy to forget that there was virtually no pub
grub then.
We spent the afternoon visiting Porlock Weir and then tackled the dreaded
hill, with me ready with the hand brake in the shape of the brick. The Riley
made it easily, although John pulled into the lay-by half way up, and topped
up the radiator with the well-advertised water supply. We travelled on across
Exmoor into Devon, having made up our minds to spend the week meandering
southwards, looking only at those farms that were a real possibility from the
sale particulars. We would enjoy what might turn out to be our last few carefree
student days and let fate take its course. We found an isolated haystack and
spent a comfortable first night under the stars. How many haystacks would you
find on Exmoor now?
I confess my memory of exactly where we went and which farms we visited is
hazy. I know we looked at about three farms in northwest Devon on the Tuesday,
but none of them left any lasting impression, except that rushes appeared to
dominate the grassland. Land prices varied between about £40 an acre in the
culm measures to £100 and more for the red land round Crediton and Exeter.
We were aiming for as many acres as we could afford between those extremes,
which meant we were in the market for a 60-acre farm. That night I slept on a
ground sheet on the grass verge beside the car, but John took to the back seat,
with a jaundiced eye on the weather.
Wednesday found us into the central ground between the two moors, not
226

Dec 29th

We Find Our First Holding

quite Devon red land, but getting away from the heavy yellow clays. One farm,
which looked promising on paper, was near the interestingly named hamlet of
Black Dog. It was down a long rough lane in the back of beyond. We got there
at about three in the afternoon, to find no one about. After knocking repeatedly,
a fiercely barking dog appeared from nowhere. That brought an irate head out
of an upstairs window, asking what the hell we wanted. The dog seemed to
interpret the words as a command to see us off the premises, and promptly
nipped John hard on the thigh. While John fended off the dog, I explained that
we understood the farm was for sale. This immediately transferred any anger
to the dog, and transformed the owner into a charming fellow, who welcomed
us to tea or something stronger, a look round the farm and an invitation to stay
the night, which we accepted.
We left the next morning, regretting that the farm at 120 acres was more
than we could afford, although it had exactly the sort of potential we were
looking for. John left his address and telephone number on the off chance of
returning to help with the harvest, when he could explore the area. We went on
with our search looking at farms as far south as Newton Abbot, but prices got
further and further out of our range. I had one disturbed night on a grass verge
near Ipplepen, when a herd of cows trampled me awake at 5.30am on their way
to be milked, much to John’s amusement from his safe back seat. We did one
day’s potato picking on a farm near Paignton, to replenish our dwindling cash
reserves (no credit cards in those days), and slept a last comfortable night in
the heather of Woodbury Common. It never rained once during our trip.
We returned to Surrey to go our separate ways and start thinking of job
prospects, little knowing that we had found the farm we would eventually buy.

Haggling for Our Farm
Following our search for a farm in Devon in July 1951, John did return to help
with the harvest on the farm near Black Dog, where we had stayed for the one
night, the only night under a roof during that memorable week. I spent the
whole of August swatting hard to retake my finals, having failed one exam in
June; I wasn’t about to risk a second failure in September and with it the loss
of my degree. I was sure I was going to need it to get a worthwhile job, and
I didn’t really hold out any hope that John would find a suitable farm in the
few weeks he would be in Devon. He phoned me on his return to Leicester
to confirm my fears, although he reckoned it would have been an ideal area in
which to start farming.
With my student days safely concluded, I took a temporary job on a large
farm in Surrey, with a half-promise of the post of under-manager if I stuck with
it, and began scanning the ‘sits vac’ columns in the farming press. It wasn’t
until much later that autumn that I heard again from John. He’d had an urgent
call from the Devon farm, saying there’d been an accident and could he go and
lend a hand.
I heard the full story later. The farmer, a retired naval captain in his fifties,
had gone out one evening to get the mill running to roll some corn for the
cattle. On many farms in those days a stationary Lister diesel engine had long
since replaced the ‘horse in its roundhouse’ as the power source for the barn
machinery. These engines were often tacked on to the side of the old threshing
barns, as in this case, in a small shed with hardly room to swing a crank
handle. The Captain had apparently caught his coat on the crank shaft and
been dragged half way up the side of the barn by the pulley belt before falling
228

Jan 5th

Haggling for Our Farm

back onto the engine. His worst injury was a very badly broken arm, but he
was fortunate to be alive.
John wasn’t the only member of the work force, and if all had gone well
would probably have returned home after a few weeks. However the Captain
made things hard for himself. To relieve the boredom of sitting around doing
nothing, he got the village taxi to take him up to the pub most evenings and
returned home at closing time often the worse for wear. He managed to fall
up the front doorstep one night when the arm was nearly mended and broke
it again. He was in and out of hospital with the doctors doing their best for
him, but it turned into a long haul. By Christmas, John found himself on his
own, struggling with the farm work while, at the same time, looking after the
Captain. I got a desperate cry for help early in the New Year, and almost
exactly 53 years ago to the day, I set off by train for Devon.
Little did I know then that apart from the occasional holiday I would be
there for good. Under John’s direction we soon got on top of the winter chores,
although I never did take well to hand milking. The Captain was another
matter. Sober he was a most entertaining host. After a few drinks with a
broken arm, he became impossible. To say he had led a colourful life would
be a considerable understatement. He had married and divorced three wives
and there was a merry widow who appeared from time to time determined to
become the fourth. Like most retired sailors, he was a competent farmer, but
he’d turned to buying and selling farms as an easier way to make money - no
capital gains tax in those days.
He would find a suitably run down farm, put in some basic mod cons and
resell at a handsome profit. I believe this was his fifth farm in as many years but
it turned out to be a farm too far, the doctors insisting he retire for the sake of
his health. By the end of February, after a lot of haggling, we’d agreed to buy
the farm for the same the price he had originally paid. He hadn’t much option,
but it was all we could scrape together and he’d had John’s unpaid labour for
over four months.
The Riley survived another year, until John wrapped it around a granite
gatepost on an icy night. It was a write-off and was sold for spares. I like to
think that the fateful dynamo may still exist under some bonnet in a vintage
car museum.

Wish List for 2005
I’ve been looking forward to this year for a very long time - in fact I’ve sometimes
wondered if I’d live to see it. Farming without subsidies! Oh yes, I know
farmers are going to be paid to be park keepers maintaining the land in ‘Good
Agricultural and Environmental Condition etc.’ or, put simply, in good nick.
But for the first time since I started farming, Whitehall is not going to exert
any influence on what we produce.
So what am I hoping for by this time next year? To start with, I would
like to swap the large laundry basket in my office for a normal waste paper
basket. Lord Whitty, the DEFRA minister who passes for our Minister of
Agriculture, since the real one considers we’re beneath her dignity to bother
about, has promised us less red tape. Not that I see the paper work declining
just yet. The latest booklets detailing the rules we must observe to earn our
park keeping money run to 80 A4 size pages. And, you can depend on it, there
will be more booklets to follow before the magic date of May 16th, when we
make that final IACS application to DEFRA. I say ‘final’ hopefully, because
I am naively assuming that in the years to come, providing we’re farming the
same farm, we’ll be able to scrawl the words ‘same as last year’ across any bumf
landing on our desks.
I might even attempt to help Lord Whitty’s prediction come true. If government no longer cares what we produce, will there be any need in future to
fill in agricultural census returns, agree to participate in farm surveys, or reply
to any of the written requests from officialdom which have been vital to secure
our subsidy money, but which never seem to have made much difference to the
prices we’ve received in the market place? It’s too much to hope this kind of
paperwork won’t still arrive in the post, but I, for one, will be increasingly
lax about returning it. Once the new system beds down, there should be only
one little brown envelope containing a cheque each year, and with luck it will
become increasingly hard for DEFRA to withhold it.
The other change I’m looking for by this time next year is our attitude as an
industry to the supermarkets. We spent Christmas with our daughter Mel and
her family in Manchester. She’s lived there ever since she left home, first as a
student and subsequently as a teacher, and I have been surprised how someone
brought up in as rural a setting as ours, with not another house in sight and
two miles from the nearest through road, can settle down so happily in a city as
large as Manchester. Apart from my student days, I’ve never lived in a city, so
visiting her has given me the ideal opportunity to see how the urban half live.

Problems of Plastic Culture

Whenever we’re there, I make a point of going along to the enormous Asda
supermarket, which I’m told is the largest individual supermarket store in Europe, to stand watching the shoppers in the dairy and meat aisles. It is very
noticeable that when it comes to food, the truly urban shopper in a supermarket wastes as little time as possible choosing what to buy. For example, on this
occasion, there was a large quantity of beef mince on display, both Irish and
UK mince, looking identical and in identical packaging but correctly labelled,
with the Irish a few pence cheaper and positioned in front of the UK. While I
watched, the mince was flying off the shelf – to forget the turkey no doubt –
but I never saw a single packet of UK mince purchased. I am willing to bet,
however, by the way the shoppers were behaving, that had the UK mince been
placed in front, the situation would have been reversed. There was plenty of
room to put the two products side by side, but that is obviously not Asda’s
policy.
If we think the supermarkets, especially the ‘Asda’s of this world, are ever
going to worry about British farmers, I am afraid we’re deluding ourselves.
So I am hoping that by the end of 2005 we will have stopped whingeing about
supermarket power – they’re only doing what comes naturally and looking after
themselves, and doing it pretty well. With no government support to turn to,
perhaps we shall at last be forced to do the same and begin to cooperate with
each other in the sort of strength that would really make a difference.

January 19th
Problems of Plastic Culture
Why is it that some items of farm rubbish, which used to fetch a little pin
money from itinerant scrap merchants, are now a financial liability? I have just
got around to reading DEFRA’s consultation paper on the Agricultural waste
regulations, which are likely to become law later this year. It is an unusual
booklet in that it contains a pull out questionnaire for us to answer and return,
together with any comments we might wish to make about the proposals. On
the face of it, this seems entirely reasonable. I know I may seem ungrateful
about what appears to be an honest attempt to include ordinary farmers in the
decision making process, a lack of which is something we’re always complaining
about, but I wonder if DEFRA is serious on this occasion. If every one of us was
to reply, and I don’t know the exact number of UK farmers, could they really
find time to go through the four pages of handwritten answers and come to
an informed conclusion? Perhaps they are assuming the questionnaire will end
up behind the mantelpiece clock, forgotten in the usual fashion, and we shall
231

2005
get an expensive and bureaucratic piece of legislation, which will be claimed as
having our full support.
I am therefore doubtful whether I shall bother to reply. We already have
a Stakeholders Forum, including all the relevant farmer organisations, dealing
with farm waste proposals. This should be quite sufficient to make sure the
eventual regulations work. And work properly, because there are some dangerous products that do need controlling. What we don’t need is a whole raft of
regulations dealing with farm materials, which have been around for centuries
and, given time, biodegrade naturally.
I rarely agree with the oft-quoted opinion that the good old times were best,
but in this case I have to concur. Gone are the days when food came home
wrapped only in paper bags, greaseproof paper or tins. On the farm, we relied
on hessian sacks and hemp twine, which often ended up over our shoulders in
the rain or round our waists supporting our trousers. We now live in a plastic
age, on the farm as well as in every day life. And the disposal of plastic by
any form of incineration produces dioxins, which I understand are among the
most toxic manmade substances in the environment, and a dangerous threat to
human health.
Unfortunately, we have come to depend on plastic in one form or another
to the extent that farming now would be almost impossible without it. Here
in the southwest, our biggest headache is the disposal of silage wrap and baler
cord, which accumulates over the winter months contaminated with mud and
slurry. The simple answer on many farms has been to strike a match. I have
always assumed that provided it burnt hot enough to produce no black smoke,
it was safe, but I am now aware that this is incorrect. So until the star struck
scientists spend less time studying the moons of Saturn, and develop a decent
biodegradable plastic, I agree that we have to accept whatever needs to be done
to recycle or dispose of the waste plastic we are saddled with.
The remaining proposals in the consultation paper look to me like typical
civil service jargon. The two that annoy me most, and are not up for discussion,
are the immediate ban on using a farm dump and the requirement to obtain a
licensing exemption to burn small quantities of wood and plant matter. What
planet are we on? We are currently laying most of our overgrown hedges on
a ten-year stewardship scheme. Some of the wood that results is sold as logs,
but most is twigs and bushy material that has to be burnt. There is no other
practical way to dispose of it and it is not small quantities. Have we to get a
licensing exemption every time we light up?
As for farm dumps, what exactly do they mean? We have had what I would
call a farm dump for years. It is a heap behind one of the farm buildings
232

Biofuel Call to Blair

of all our broken or worn out farm machinery. It is a source of spare parts
(recycling) or metal for welding (reusing for another purpose), exactly what the
Government is keen to encourage. How is it suggested we store this in future?
As for the other hazard waste that concerns DEFRA, such as pesticide containers, tyres, batteries etc, they should be returned to the original manufacturers for disposal. That may be an added cost, but theirs is the responsibility
for the production of a hazardous material.

January 26th
Biofuel Call to Blair
They say travel broadens the mind. What they don’t say is that since the
advent of the railways, travel is helping to heat up the planet. Before then,
all travel was on foot or by horse, and global warming, if any, was an act of
God. This train of thought, if you’ll excuse the pun, was brought about by the
pictures on television last week of the European leaders in Toulouse, France,
unveiling the new super jumbo, which Tony Blair claimed would change the
way we travel. That may well be true, but the most significant change that
the largest passenger plane in the world is likely to achieve is an increase in air
travel.
To be fair, it is claimed to burn less fuel than other long-haul aircraft,
bringing the fuel consumption per passenger to a rate comparable to a family
car. You can’t really blame the politicians for hyping this up to overcome any
feelings of guilt we may have when booking our flight to far away places. After
all, if it’s no more polluting than driving there in our car, why worry? Of course,
that overlooks the fact that we’d undoubtedly have four, not one, in a car if
we actually went that way, and we’d be paying a hefty tax on the fuel as well.
But what will certainly encourage more of us to fly these long distances will
be comfort and price. Jenny and I, with relatives in Australia, might well be
persuaded. Not that we shall travel cheaper than an early Pettifer, who stole a
sheep and got there for nothing on the first boat out. Comfort, under sail, may
have been lacking, but he subsequently did all right and his journey certainly
had no adverse effect on the environment.
And that’s where I part company with our present government’s policy on
renewable energy. I’m not sure where I stand on wind turbines, which seems to
be their preferred option at present, but which I suspect may be partly cosmetic.
I don’t like seeing them in large numbers, except in very isolated locations, and
I certainly don’t like the look of them out to sea, where I believe they are most
effective. But if I were sure they could make a real difference to our electricity
233

2005
supplies, I would gladly put up with them. The argument that they are an
intermittent source of electricity, and therefore do little to reduce power station
capacity, doesn’t allow for the fact that, provided they are located very widely,
there is nearly always a wind blowing somewhere in the British Isles to provide
cover for each other. What they fail to do completely, however, is to provide
power for transport. And that’s where this government is failing us completely.
Carol Trewin wrote a very persuasive lead article in this paper a month
ago. It should be compulsory reading for every MP. She pointed out that
carbon dioxide emissions, of which road transport produces 22 per cent, have
not declined at all since this government came to power eight years ago and
look set to increase. The obvious immediate remedy is the development of the
green fuel industry in this country, something where other countries are already
way ahead of us.
It is strange to realize that only 170 years ago, farms provided all our inland
motive power in the form of oats. The canals, which transported so much
of our heavy goods, depended on horsepower, as did the few railways that
existed before steam took over. For another 100 years, farms continued to
depend on horses for almost all their energy requirements, and only since I
started farming has land ceased to grow any worthwhile energy crops. At this
depressed time in farming fortunes, what a boost to our morale it would be if we
could once again make a real contribution to clean energy, without impacting
on anyone’s enjoyment of the rural landscape. We have one tenth of our arable
land producing nothing as set aside, waiting to be utilized. We already export
enough wheat, which if converted to bioethanol would meet our EU target of
5% of biofuels by 2010, and which I understand would also meet Tony Blair’s
CO2 emissions target for 2050 by the year 2010.
So what about it, Prime Minister? You have an election in the offing. You
act as if you expect to remain in office for another five years; you would still
be around to claim the credit for doing something that those of us who live in
rural areas would at last appreciate. Instruct your Chancellor to adjust green
fuel tax to the level of other countries and allow us to get on with the job.

Burial Ban Correct

February 2nd
Burial Ban Correct
The other day, an old ewe did what sheep do best - she died. Lambing time is
nearly with us and this ewe had developed twin-lamb disease; although treated,
she failed to get over it. I have never understood why sheep die so readily.
Cows when terminally ill will hang on with grim determination and have to be
put down, but sheep seem to stop breathing as soon as you look the other way.
This one went so quickly that I hadn’t time to sign up with the new National
Fallen Stock Company, before getting our local knacker to collect her.
We have been meaning to join since the scheme started last November, but
with nothing dying and the usual Christmas rush, it got overlooked. Having
left it this long, I went to a meeting in Exeter last Wednesday where the NFSCo
Chairman, Michael Seals, a Derbyshire beef farmer, explained how things were
going. 20,000 farmers have already joined and there had been over 15,000
collections. This has drawn down £150,000 worth of the Government’s support
for the 30% discount.
The questions raised by the farmers present about direct debit billing and
collection facilities were very adequately answered by Mr Seals, who appears
determined to keep costs of administration to an absolute minimum. A monthly
direct debit, ten days after receipt of a detailed invoice, is certainly easier than
our present method of payment, which involves hanging around with a cheque
for when the lorry arrives.
Our real worry was the likelihood that costs would rise to swallow up government funding, leaving us tied into a system outside our control. This doesn’t
look like happening at present. Disposing of our dead ewe through the scheme,
using our usual knacker, would have saved us £7, exactly 30% of our usual
disposal fee, so it doesn’t appear that the National Company is being charged
exorbitant prices.
We’ve now joined and doing that was simplicity itself. One phone call, a few
details of our business, and five minutes later, with a number to quote when
phoning our knacker, we are all ready for our next sheep or bullock to die. And
sooner or later it surely will – as the old saying goes “where there’s livestock,
there’s dead stock”.
However, one thing that keeps on coming up as it did the other night, and
as it does so often in letters to the press, is this idea that we are suddenly doing
something unusual in not burying our dead animals. I keep reading about the
iniquity of being allowed to bury ‘Granny’ in the garden, but not allowed to
bury a favourite cow in the corner of the home pasture. I can’t say I’m very
235

2005
keen to do either. People seem to forget that until BSE reared its ugly head
we never buried anything unless we absolutely had to. Most of us didn’t own a
ditcher, and digging a hole by hand large enough for a cow was no joke. Add
to that, a dead cow fetched ten to fifteen quid from the knacker. Even a sheep
had a value and was collected free.
Burying animals was not a very clever thing to do anyway. It doesn’t happen
in nature, where there are plenty of scavengers to dispose of animals that die
unnaturally. A natural death in the wild is to be caught and eaten. Putting
bodies underground, especially as deep as modern machinery allows, does not
encourage quick decomposition, and must increase the risk of contamination of
streams and rivers. And these days more and more of that water eventually
comes out of our taps.
I know I was as annoyed by the burial ban as we all were, when it came into
force two years ago. I still think there is very little harm in the shallow burial
of the odd sheep or lamb on high ground. But I am coming round to the idea
that, while the BSE prion, apparently almost indestructible, is around in the
environment, we should take absolutely no chances. Large-scale burial on farm
is no longer an option.
The unfortunate side is that meat and bone meal, the end product of all the
unusable remains of livestock farming, used to be a commodity in its own right.
It was a first class material as a natural fertiliser; it was also highly digestive
feed for pigs and poultry, natural omnivores. Until the scientists develop a
foolproof way of destroying prions other than by incineration, are we destined
never to be able to recycle, as we used to do, this most valuable waste material?

What Is a Spud?
Here’s another slant on that hoary old riddle about why the chicken crossed the
road. Answer: “To avoid crossing up DEFRA by poaching the field”. I’m being
frivolous I know, but with four or five hundred other farmers, I was attending
the DEFRA meeting about the Single Payment Scheme at the Exeter Cattle
Market last Thursday afternoon. I’m told the morning session was also crowded
and with only one person allowed per farm, DEFRA must have covered a pretty
big chunk of Devon farmland that day. Why the interest? Well, we had gathered
to view the promised land of less paperwork and simpler form filling and learn
more about the tablets of stone that went with it.
In my case, and I’m sure it was the same for many other farmers present,
the chance to actually see a sample of the application form well in advance was
236

Feb 16th

What Is a Spud?

the big draw. Thankfully, at first sight it doesn’t look too bad. In fact, for
those of us who have been doing IACS since it started in 1993, and especially
if we are farming the same acres this year as in the past, it might, dare I say it,
be straightforward. Much of the information required will be ‘prefilled’ (a new
DEFRA word), with many of the questions only needing a cross in the yes/no
space. The title even includes area payments for Nuts – that lets me out.
For farmers who are new to all this, or who have bought or sold land in the
last few years, it doesn’t look so good. Phrases like ‘horticultural authorisations’ and ‘reference amounts’ appear here and there, and there are columns for
activating and establishing entitlements. But for most of us, it could have been
worse, as was evident by the lack of questions on it from the audience.
The second half of the meeting was a different story. While the promise of
reduced paper work in the years ahead appears a distinct possibility, the cross
compliance regulations generated questions galore. As you would expect, there
was much confusion about the rules on set-aside and the difference between
permanent and temporary grassland. Seeing that set aside for this year started
a month ago and with a video camera recording our every word, I was surprised
anyone had the nerve to speak out.
However, the biggest bone of contention centred round the future use of
in-field round feeders. How tough were inspectors going to be about poaching
and damage to soil structure through keeping animals out during the winter?
Which is where my chicken riddle comes in. A question about free-range hens
had the DEFRA panel somewhat non-plussed. Satellite images may be able to
distinguish the make of tractor we are misusing the ground with, but will they
show up a flock of hens scratching about? The advice given was to plough out
and reseed when the field becomes bare, as with chicken it obviously will. But
if the new grass is undersown in a cereal crop, I presume some of the field will
then have to be put into set-aside.
What a nonsense some of these regulations really are, but whether we like it
or not mud-free farming is here to stay. Even the humble spud has got caught
up in it. Apparently in fine weather the potato is an ordinary vegetable. In
heavy rain, however, it loses its identity and cannot be harvested like other
vegetables, but has to remain in the ground. What it becomes isn’t clear: the
question is being aptly referred back to Brussels.
When challenged on the reason for the plethora of rules inflicted on us here
in England, compared with the very small number in the rest of Europe, DEFRA was quick to point out that 90% of them already exist in law and were
included for the sake of clarity. Ominously, we were warned it was possible to
find ourselves both docked of our single farm payment and up before a magis237

2005
trate for the same infringement. But we shouldn’t be too alarmed. To ensure
uniformity, a National Inspection Agency has been set up, and future inspectors
are already being enrolled. When trained, they will be visiting us in pairs, to
avoid individual bias. Or maybe for their own safety.
I hope I am not coming across as ungrateful to DEFRA for making a big
effort to help us through this bureaucratic minefield. If we found some of their
answers difficult to swallow, I’m sure we appreciated the very generous supply
of refreshments that ended the meeting, to which we didn’t really do justice.
There were plenty of sandwiches left over for DEFRA’s next road show.

February 23rd
River Trout Return
With so much of the media attention focused on foxes recently, I thought you’d
appreciate it if I wrote about a completely different animal found on our farm.
This particular animal came to my attention very soon after I arrived here,
when the next-door farmer appeared on his bank of the stream that formed
the boundary between us. I think he’d wandered over to see what his new
neighbours were like, and as we were chatting across a few feet of very shallow
water the subject of fish came up. Did I know we had brown trout here? I didn’t
know much about fish and being a green college-boy farmer, I thought he was
joshing me and told him so. There was barely enough water for a stickleback,
let alone a trout.
A friend who was with him immediately offered to prove it and told me to
kneel on the bank and feel gently along under the edge of a deeper pool. To
my surprise, I almost immediately disturbed a small fish about the size of a
pilchard. I spent the next very enjoyable hour being taught to guddle, or as it
is more generally known, to tickle trout.
The fish I eventually caught, when fried on a piece of toast for tea, was
delicious, but I confess I have never subsequently tried to repeat my success.
From the trout’s point of view, it is possibly the kindest way of being dispatched.
I wonder what the animal rights brigade’s view of this is. Is it an illegal way of
catching fish? The drawback to it as a method of getting a free meal is the loss
of sensation in the arm and hand after a short time in very cold water.
Our farm is on the higher reaches of the river Creedy, only about two miles
from its source. There have been times when trout have been absent from the
stream here. When Downes Mill, just south of Crediton, was built in the 19th
century, the way upstream for spawning fish was inadvertently blocked, and the
238

Mar 2nd

Icy Chill as Spring Arrives Like a Lion

locals were up in arms at the loss of their fishing rights. It apparently took
many years for the fish to return.
Something similar happened in 1968. Jim, then an 11 year old, came into
the farmyard with a bucketful of dead trout, which he and a friend had found
floating in the stream. The water was a dark brown colour and stank like a
sewer. We discovered that a new neighbour, an ex-Rhodesian farmer newly
returned from the troubles of Ian Smith’s UDI, had dug a ditch direct from
his milking shippon and was hosing his cattle manure straight into the Creedy,
instead of making a dung heap with a wheelbarrow like the rest of us.
The trout are back again now. Jim happened to see them by the light of a
torch, when he was searching for missing heifer one night last December.

March 2nd
Icy Chill as Spring Arrives Like a Lion
It is a bitterly cold but dry morning as I write. A posse of ten-day old lambs
is galloping up and down the fence outside my window. It’s that time of year
again. There are only about 25 ewes left to lamb and after a hectic two weeks
for Bev, the lambing shed is beginning to look less crowded at night. The ewes
with very young lambs and the unlambed ewes are brought in each evening for
ease of management and to be safe from predators, but it is the only time in
their lives that they spend under cover.
The cattle on the other hand are all in this year and have been since Christmas. It’s the first year since we gave up dairying and switched to suckler cows
that we haven’t out wintered some of the cattle on a sacrifice field. The cattle
that stayed out always seemed healthier and the field, although it looked a terrible mess by the spring, always recovered without us attempting to reseed. Not
that it produced much grass through the summer; it just returned to a state of
natural grasses, clovers and wild flowers, a typical Devon wildlife pasture. In
future we would be breaking the rules on cross compliance and forfeiting our
single farm payment if we continued like that. I’m not sure the environmental
experts really know what they are talking about when they dream up these
ideas. Fifty years ago the whole field was solid bracken, head high, with very
little wildlife to show for it. Would they prefer it if we let the field revert to
that?
Meanwhile, I presume this is March coming in like a lion; it may be relatively
quiet, but it is certainly cold enough. If I’m right, March should go out like a
lamb and we can look forward to warm growing conditions in April. We shall
need it. The bedding in the cattle yards is getting deeper by the day, making it
239

2005
harder to keep the animals clean. We have silage and hay enough, but our straw
is virtually out, and Jim has had to order a load to arrive this week, hopefully
to take us through to turnout time. Had we kept the usual number of animals
outside, the extra straw might not have been required, so any added expense
should be set against the single farm payment if and when we eventually receive
it this time next year.
We shall soon have to be thinking of spring tilling. The triticale, which we
sowed very late last autumn, came up all right, although every rook in this
part of Devon congregated on it each morning for a free meal, and had to be
frightened off at frequent intervals to give the grain a chance to germinate. It
certainly isn’t winter proud, but if it’s anything like winter wheat in it’s growing
habit and in view of the hard frosts, it should be all the better for that. I’m no
expert when it comes to arable farming, but that’s what my father-in-law used
to say and he was.
Jim is intending to put the remaining 15 acres of arable ground into spring
barley, probably under sown with a red clover ley. No oats for us this year, by the
look of it: spring oats have never done very well on our ground. The sheep will
miss them next lambing time; we feed whole oats through the lambing period,
which also acts as an inducement to get them to return to the buildings each
evening. Jim could save back a couple of ton of oats, of which we have plenty
from the year before last’s harvest, but whether it will keep well into a third
year, even though treated with proprionic acid, I don’t know. Growing swedes
for one season on all the arable acres may have been good for the rotation, but
has produced problems in trying to supply all our livestock feed and bedding
from our own resources.
Gone are the days when we grew a bit of this and a bit of that on different
fields dotted about the farm. Dependence on contractors for ploughing, combining and baling has put paid to that on our size of holding. In fact, I wouldn’t be
at all surprised if Jim decides to pension off our old silage harvester and employ
contractors for silage making as well this coming summer, and even changing
from clamp to round bale silage for the first time ever for us. That’s if we can
afford it.

I Would Not Hesitate to Shoot Badger

March 9th
I Would Not Hesitate to Shoot Badger
I could hear a sheep bleating plaintively at first light the other morning, before
I’d had my early cup of tea. I went to investigate and found that a ewe had
lost her twin lambs. They were very dead and partially eaten in a manner that
indicated a badger rather than a fox had enjoyed a midnight feast. Whether
they had been killed by the badger there was no way of knowing, although
they were big strong fortnight old lambs and seemed perfectly healthy when
I checked the flock the night before. There is plenty of evidence of badgers
searching for worms under last year’s cowpats in adjacent fields, although with
the recent hard frosts I doubt they were having much success. If the lambs
had died naturally, I could hardly begrudge the badger a free meal, but just in
case it was more than that, I patrolled the surrounding fields with a gun and a
strong torch for the next few nights.
I am glad to say I saw no badgers and we have lost no more lambs to
date, but had I found a badger in the act of killing a lamb, I wouldn’t have
hesitated to shoot it. That is if I was close enough to be certain of dispatching
it, which would have been my only consideration. Hold on, I hear you say, you
can’t do that, you’d be breaking the law. With all the publicity about TB and
badgers, and the impossibility of persuading DEFRA to issue permits to take
out badgers on infected farms, you could be excused for assuming that was the
case. In fact, as I understand it, I would be well within my rights, even to the
extent of overcoming my scruples and not worrying about merely wounding the
offending animal.
The 1992 Protection of Badgers Act states quite clearly that “A person is
not guilty of an offence in killing or attempting to kill a badger if he shows that
his action was necessary for the purpose of preventing serious damage to land,
crops, poultry or any other form of property”.
Before you start assuming that I’m just a trigger-happy farmer, only too
anxious to loose off at any offending wildlife that is causing trouble, can I
assure you that I am compassionate to a fault. The vermin round here are
under the impression that I am the worst shot in the county; they may well
be right, so long as they don’t twig that I’m doing my best to avoid hitting
them. The recently announced edict that in future we may not shoot crows or
magpies until we have tried all other methods of frightening them away, I have
been following for years.
There have been occasions in the past when we have had to shoot the odd
rogue fox. That was generally for taking newborn lambs in the days when
241

2005
we lambed outdoors in April or May or sometimes when the farmyard hens
started going missing. Our badgers have also occasionally been guilty of taking
poultry, but they’ve not needed any ‘protection of badgers’ acts to feel virtually
sacrosanct on this farm.
One very common animal, which I do consider vermin and an insufferable
immigrant, and which I would cheerfully see eliminated, is the grey squirrel.
However it has also led a charmed life since it arrived here in the 1960s, but
for a more unusual reason. Jim, aged about 13, found a baby squirrel on the
ground, where it had obviously fallen from its drey. Its eyes were still shut and it
must have been only a few days old. Against all the odds, Jim managed to rear
it, keeping it in our airing cupboard and feeding it milk every few hours with
a pipette. It eventually had the run of the house, but we had great difficulty
keeping it away from the cats, which were convinced it was a young rat. In the
end the inevitable happened, and the cats won.
That wasn’t the end of the story. The following year, another baby squirrel
became orphaned in similar circumstances. Jim was keen to try again, but we
were not anxious to repeat the previous trauma. However, one of our cats had
just had two kittens, one of which was stillborn, and Jim rather boldly replaced
it with the baby squirrel. I confess I rather callously thought it was probably
better to let the cat eat it then as later. To my surprise, the cat readily accepted
it and reared it to weaning. We ended up with a squirrel-cat, which the dogs and
cats ignored. However, the kitten that had been reared with it went through
life with some strange psychological problems, believing itself to be a squirrel.

Paying the Price of a Visit to Town
I got fined recently for illegal parking in our local town. I had just nipped
into the bank to pay in some cheques having parked in the nearby side street,
as I’ve been doing for the past 50 years. Only half the street is legal parking
these days but I was one car length beyond. I came out of the bank less than
five minutes later to see the traffic warden disappearing smartly down the main
street. I could hardly believe it when I found a £30 fine notice slapped on my
car window. To say I was fuming would be an understatement. I was so cross
I wasn’t even thinking straight. I drove off, swearing under my breath, to do
some grocery shopping at our local supermarket, where there were more cars
and people than there were in the town centre. Had I paused to think, I could
have left the car where it was and shopped at leisure as I used to do. Or can
you be fined £30 repeatedly every half hour or so? To rub salt into the wound,
242

Mar 16th

Paying the Price of a Visit to Town

I see in the local paper that the town council are now proposing to extend the
parking further up my little-used side street.
I recount this sorry tale, which has happened to most of us at one time or
another, to highlight the obvious. Shopping at a supermarket on the edge of
town is far easier for country folk, most of whom own cars in these days of
declining public transport, than trying to find space within shopping bag range
of the traditional shops. Supermarket planners always seem to ensure that their
car park is adequate for their premises; in fact I cannot recall ever visiting one
that was completely full. If, as I suspect, the local planning authorities demand
this, are the same guidelines adopted for town centre planning?
We talk about supermarkets having farmers in an armlock over their pricing
policies and the inability of government to do anything about it. But our
market-town shops, which could provide better competition and are surely easier
to supply with local farm produce, are often at a considerable disadvantage. I
am not suggesting that our local towns do not have central car parks - they
all do, but they are never big enough and appear to be viewed as a source of
easy money. I know of only one in this part of North Devon that always has
space available at the busiest time of the day and is free. And that is not in
the middle of the town. It seems as if over the years whenever an opportunity
has arisen through redevelopment, enlarging the car parking facilities has come
last, instead of first, on the list of priorities.
Perhaps I’m still smarting over that £30 fine and being unfair to our local
councillors, but I would dearly like to get back to doing the weekly shopping in
the town and only calling in at the supermarket on the way home for missing
items, instead of the reverse. At the moment, if my bank were to open a counter
in the supermarket, which could happen, I would be sorely tempted to avoid
the town centre altogether.
Paying fines isn’t what it used to be either. I almost considered taking the
option of going to court on this occasion to plead that the fine was out of line
with the offence, but I reckoned I would probably end up paying half as much
again. Apart from the odd speeding ticket, the last time I got done for a minor
traffic offence I was fined 30 shillings (£1.50) for having an unsafe load in the
village street. An empty milk churn fell off the tractor-trailer, where upon I
stopped and replaced it immediately. The local village bobby saw me from fifty
yards away and, seeking promotion, considered it to be an open and shut case.
In those days you were encouraged to attend the local magistrates court, even
if pleading guilty, which I obviously was. The beak having had the satisfaction
of giving you a public dressing down, could then apply the minimum fine. On
this occasion, I wished to cross-examine my friendly bobby as to the exact
243

2005
circumstances of the offence. I was therefore instructed by the bench to plead
not guilty and, after listening to the severe ear wigging received by the police
for bringing trifling cases to court, I paid the fine quite cheerfully.

March 23rd
What a Waste of Time
If you had told me last Christmas that the instruction booklets we would be
getting from DEFRA by this Easter would be as long-winded to read as one
of Shakespeare’s plays, I might just have believed you. In fact DEFRA has
surpassed itself. The reality is such that, at a rough word-count, in applying for
the two new schemes – the Single Payment Scheme and the Entry Level Scheme,
we shall be obliged to read the equivalent of ‘Much Ado About Nothing’, ‘A
Midsummer Night’s Dream’, ‘As You Like It’ and ‘All’s Well That Ends Well’.
The Bard might have been much amused. He was, after all, the son of a yeoman
farmer, who was once fined a shilling for having an unauthorised dunghill in
Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon. I wonder what official document Shakespeare senior failed to fill in properly - red tape obviously existed even in Tudor
times.
I don’t find it very funny at all. It is suggested somewhere that we read
these booklets through carefully two or three times to be sure we understand
them, seeing we only have this one chance of getting it right. During the last
few weeks, I have been to ‘road shows’ and ‘workshops’, fancy names for farmer
meetings, to be shown how to fill in the application forms when we do finally
get them. The sample forms, which were available to practise on, don’t appear
too formidable. We have, all of us, had a lot of experience over the years; it is
the required reading that goes with them that is wearing me down.
The ultimate example, which we received a few days ago, is the Organic
Entry Level Stewardship Handbook – 150 pages of glossy magazine. It is quite
good enough to take its place on the coffee tables of the rich and famous. It
has a splendid front cover depicting sheep grazing a red clover ley, and is liberally illustrated throughout with coloured photos of every kind of conservation
activity, from cattle in fields full of buttercups, to sunflowers in full bloom and,
for no obvious reason, a ‘bloody nosed’ beetle on meadowsweet.
Who, for heavens sake, decided to spend time and money dreaming up
something as expensive as this - Margaret Beckett, perhaps, or was it some
senior official at DEFRA? I presume that under the Freedom of Information
Act, which has allowed DEFRA to publish our subsidy payment details to all
and sundry, we shall have no difficulty in finding out how much this ministry
244

Mar 30th

That Buzz of Benchmark

extravagance actually cost. In our case, it is very easy to demonstrate what good
value for money the public has had out of supporting beef and sheep farming.
The nation can import food at knockdown world prices, and still find cows in
the buttercups and sheep in the clover to provide chocolate-box pictures, with
bloody nosed farmers kept discreetly out of sight. When it comes to ministry
publications, can DEFRA do the same?
Rather ominously, I read on the last page of their handbook a footnote
stating that ‘if we enter an Environment Stewardship agreement, it will be
with the Secretary of State and this handbook will form part of it’, whatever
that means. It certainly implies that we are obliged to read it right through.
What we really needed at this time was a compact, short, easy to absorb manual
setting out the various options available to allow us to apply. A 30-page booklet,
with no photos, would have been ample.
There is a danger that some farmers will just throw in the towel, and with
plenty of spring work to get on with, decide there are better ways to earn an
extra £12 an acre - because that’s what it amounts to. In our own case there is
more at stake. If we are to benefit from the government incentive to convert to
organic farming, we are obliged to fulfil all the conditions of this environment
scheme, with all the extra paperwork that’s involved. Any conversion payments
are inextricably tied to it. It is not sufficient, as it used to be, to join an organisation like the Soil Association, with all their bookkeeping and inspections,
which organic neighbours warn me are pretty horrendous already.
Ah, well. Roll on June 1st by which date all this form filling has to be completed. Maybe I shall wake up on that morning and find it was all a midsummer
night’s nightmare, and we are back to farming without a piece of paper in sight,
as it was when I started. Who knows – with global warming it may not be
many years before it is again.

March 30th
That Buzz of Benchmark
The clocks have gone forward and the cows and calves are out to grass. I look
forward to both events every year, the signs that winter is virtually over, that
spring is here and summer’s not far behind. It is unusual for the cows to go out
at exactly the date the clocks change; it depends on ground conditions, grass
growth and most importantly how much fodder is left in the barns. Varying
from year to year, it should be the real signal to shed the winter blues, but the
start of summer time, whatever the weather, fixed like some ancient saints day, is
when I really feel my spirits lift. As the years have gone by it has almost become
245

2005
more important as a reference point or benchmark in the farming calendar than
Michaelmas or Lady Day used to be.
‘Benchmark’ is one of the new buzzwords in farming circles, like ‘stakeholder’
or ‘workshop’, that we seem to be using freely out of context nowadays. We
have two real benchmarks on the farm, which I often notice with some nostalgia
when passing. A couple of old chaps turned up one day in the 1950s, who said
they were surveyors checking the benchmarks in the area. There was one on a
barn wall, an upturned V below a ‘dash’ chiselled into the stone, registering an
exact height above sea level, which I hadn’t seen before they pointed it out. I
subsequently discovered another on an older barn about 100 yards further up
the hill, so which the correct one was I’m still not sure. With sea levels rising,
I don’t suppose it matters much now, and I’m told that they are no longer of
any importance for surveying purposes, with Global Positioning Systems and
satellites taking over. I know we are about 500 feet above sea level, which affects
the productivity of this farm, and the benchmarks will continue to remind me
of that while the old stone barns remain standing.
What brought all this up was a meeting I went to three weeks ago entitled
‘How Benchmarking can improve your business’. Obviously height above sea
level had nothing to do with this, or perhaps only obliquely. It was presented by
the Red Meat Industry Forum, an organisation new to me. They are currently
trying to persuade beef and lamb producers to become more profitable by getting us to compare our performance with others in our locality. It is something
we have always been behind the other mainstream enterprises in doing. For
a start, it is not as simple as making comparisons with dairy, pig, poultry, or
arable farms. For many of us, beef and sheep farming has been an accessory to
those enterprises, but I accept that with the new Single Farm Payments that
may well change, and on many farms here in the South West, beef and sheep
could become all-important.
More than that, extensive beef and sheep production is influenced more
by the soil type, prevailing weather and topography of a farm. Most of us in
these circumstances still fly by the seat of our pants to survive the fluctuations
in market prices. The farm gate price can vary enormously within a year,
compared with other commodities. I have known the value of early lamb be
as high as £70 in March and drop to £35 by July. That level of fluctuation
may decline in future, but I could argue that knowing what other farmers are
doing might help us by ensuring we don’t follow their example when timing
our marketing. That is hardly the object of benchmarking as proposed at
the meeting. If it did lead on eventually to solving the long-term problem of
246

Apr 6th

Did Rabbits Hold the Answer to TB

persuading beef and lamb producers to market cooperatively in a big way, it
will have been well worthwhile.
I rather like the story I was told by a surveyor friend of mine. He was using
benchmarks, working with a team some years ago in the north of England. They
had to find a benchmark on a particular stone gatepost, and when they located
it, they discovered a similar mark on the other post of the gate. The owner
turned up to see what they were doing, and when asked, explained that he had
at one time knocked down the original gateway, but so liked the benchmark that
he had used the same post when replacing it. He had gone further and acquired
another similarly marked stone from somewhere else to make a matching pair.
Height above sea level hadn’t come into his reckoning.

April 6th
Did Rabbits Hold the Answer to TB
Our TB herd test, which is due shortly, is looming over us. It is two years since
our last routine test and in normal times, having never had a reactor in all the
years we’ve been here, we would be not be feeling particularly apprehensive. We
are a closed herd, only buying in stock bulls and the occasional breeding cow,
and always from reputable TB-free farms. The likelihood of a cow developing
TB should be minimal.
But these are not normal times. With TB spreading throughout the county
like some latter-day cattle plague and more and more farms going down with
their first ever case, it is inevitable that we are worried. Losing good breeding
stock, that in a sense are native to this farm, knowing the boundaries of their
grazing areas and gravitating naturally back to the farm buildings, together
with the shear waste of time that rounding all the cattle up every 60 days for
repeat tests, a process which one reactor would set in motion, doesn’t bear
thinking about.
What is so different now to the early days of eradicating TB from the national herd, which began in the late 1930s? When I started farming, less than a
quarter of farms in Britain were attested. There were probably as many cattle
carrying TB as there were cattle that had been tested free of the disease. The
testing procedures were the same, with repeat tests every 60 days, the length
of the incubation period, until a herd was clear. Over time, whole areas of the
country were cleared, and provided we took normal precautions about double
fencing and buying only from attested herds, the worry of a breakdown faded
into the background, and one could be pretty sure of being able to pinpoint the
source if it did occur.
247

2005
Now it seems to hit a farm out of nowhere. No obvious contacts, no vast
reservoir of TB in the national herd, and yet farms going down with it almost
at random. To suggest that the today’s testing procedure is somehow at fault
doesn’t fit. 50 years ago, the majority of herds were not tested at all, and yet
we steadily progressed with an eradication programme that nearly eliminated
TB completely. It is not surprising therefore that farmers conclude there is an
alternative reservoir of infection around now, which was not there in those days,
or if it was, was not presenting much danger to cattle.
Looking back, one feature of the wildlife then on this farm was the extraordinary number of rabbits. I have mentioned before in this column the difficulty
we had to successfully farm at all. For the first two or three years, we regularly
had the local rabbit trapper in every winter, as did every other farm in the
district. The joke was that the money from the rabbits was enough to pay the
rent. I have been trying to remember roughly how many were caught each year
here, but to confirm my estimate, I phoned Paul Isaac, an old friend who was
a member of the family that used to farm a mile down the valley from us. He
recalls that they had to trap the rabbits themselves for a couple of years, when
the regular trapper retired, and out of interest they kept a count. If you can
believe it, in one winter on their 110-acre farm, they caught 1800 rabbits.
Our farm was about the same size, and nothing grew for about five yards
out from any hedgerow. It was one of the incentives to push out the hedges:
the larger the fields the less the relative loss of crops. This enormous number of
rabbits resulted in a much higher fox population, which needed controlling and
which for many farmers produced a regular source of pin money through the
use of wire snares and the sale of fox skins. And inevitably, animals other than
foxes got caught. Farm cats and dogs sometimes and badgers frequently. Devon
hedge-banks are ideal for producing a much-used route for the larger mammals,
on which it is relatively simple to set snares. I am sure a great many wandering
badgers were caught. Could this have been sufficient to cut down the possible
cross infection of TB from sett to sett in those days?
Rabbit numbers are now a fraction of what they were, fox numbers are
proportionally down and wire snares are no longer a problem for badgers. But
one of the obvious ways in which badgers were unintentionally controlled has
gone. That and the very big increase in their numbers is the worry on every
cattle farm. The sooner the badger protection societies accept this, and help
us get the TB situation under control, the fewer the total number of badgers
that will end up being culled. The politicians might listen to them – they don’t
appear to be listening to us.

Wilson Was Surprised

Wilson Was Surprised
General elections always seem to come at busy or difficult times in farming. We
are only a week into this election and I’m already fed up with the continual
party political trench warfare which fills the extended TV news programmes to
exhaustion. Here on the farm, we are currently grappling with TB herd testing,
getting our spring barley and grass seeds drilled, and rolling our grass ground.
We are also preparing finally, after all the hours of farmer teach-ins and studying
of instruction pamphlets, to actually fill in the wretched forms for the Single
Farm Payment and Entry Level Schemes. All will be completed I hope by the
time the outcome of the General Election is known. I suspect that a successful
conclusion to these farm jobs will have more bearing in the next twelve months
on our personal well being than anything the election may inflict on us. I am
not being small minded when I make that comment - its just that farming and
food production hardly appear to figure anywhere in the political manifestos.
There’s plenty of food, so the nation can forget all about that necessity of life.
This time four years ago, at the last election, we were in the throes of the
worst foot and mouth epidemic seen in a generation, caused almost certainly
by political incompetence. The most pressing aspect then appeared to be the
possible interference with an election date that declaring a ‘state of emergency’
and bringing in the army might have induced. The army came in eventually,
but only after the disease had peaked, which was really too late. The cost to
life in the countryside, at the time, seemed of secondary importance.
Go back four more years to the election of May 1997, and farmers were
still reeling from the effects of BSE. We had watched with disbelief the efforts
of the then Agriculture Minister, Douglas Hogg, dressed like an Australian
bushwhacker, trailing round the capitals of Europe at John Major’s heels, trying
to get our beef back on European menus. I recall a meeting in Tavistock cattle
market during that election campaign, when John Major, confronted by about
sixty local farmers, found the most pressing question he had to answer was
whether he would promise to sack Hogg if the Conservatives were re-elected.
He did, in a round about way, but they weren’t.
I suppose one of the most amusing incidents for me that occurred in an election campaign was in October 1974. Harold Wilson had called a snap election
after some months of presiding over a minority government. He came down to
Exeter to address Labour party workers and a few of us, under the leadership
of Wallace Day and John James, thought it a good opportunity to bring the
then farming problems to his attention. We found the rear entrance to the hall
249

2005
where his meeting was being held unattended and seated ourselves among the
delegates. At question time, Wallace duly got up and began to put his concerns, to be immediately silenced by a very angry Wilson, who accused him
of slipping unnoticed into a private meeting. At that John James rose to his
considerable height and pointed out that we had all entered quite openly without challenge. Whereupon half a dozen stewards grabbed an unresisting John
and started carrying him horizontally shoulder high from the hall. Their leader
seemed to have John’s head in a tight armlock, and worried that he might be
having difficulty breathing, I found myself trying to give the steward the same
treatment, until John whispered that I should let go in case I was spoiling good
television coverage. Wilson, no slouch himself when dealing with the media,
spotted his mistake and, ordering John’s release, affably agreed that since we
were there he would answer Wallace’s questions. He was too late however and
the nine o’clock TV news that evening carried some memorable footage of the
sort of difficulties farmers were experiencing with government policies.
In case you are thinking from all this that I’m politically biased, may I
hasten to point out that I’m the archetypal floating voter. I have in my time
voted for each of the three main parties, although I tend to draw the line at
supporting single-issue parties as being a wasted vote. In the immediate post
war years, food production was very much an election issue. Not so today.
Perhaps if the very hot summer that is being forecast is followed by more hot
dry years, a succession of poor harvests around the world could change all that
and bring agriculture to the top of a future election agenda.

April 20th
Scandal of Food Waste
There is nothing like a good rabbit stew. We ran over a rabbit on our way home
in the dark the other night, and stopped to make sure it was dead. It must
have run into the back wheel of the car and broken its neck; it was otherwise
unmarked. So into the pot it went for supper the following night – ‘waste not
want not’ as the saying goes.
Wild rabbit used to be one of the staples of a countryman’s diet. It’s seems
to have gone out of fashion in recent years, partly probably because the sight
of a rabbit with myxomatosis is somewhat off-putting, even though the disease
is not contagious to us. As a teenager, I used to skive off school occasionally
and go ferreting. I am the world’s worst cook, but the smoky taste of a freshly
killed rabbit grilled over a woodland fire lingers still; I suspect that being a
growing lad in the days of meat rationing has a lot to do with it. We have
250

Apr 20th

Scandal of Food Waste

a few rabbits about now and it would really be no problem to shoot one now
and then, but the convenience and cheapness of supermarket shopping seems
to make a sluggard of me.
On the subject of waste, I heard a report on the radio the other morning
which stated that in the UK we waste roughly 30% of all our food. I didn’t
gather how that figure had been arrived at, but if it’s true, what an appalling
state of affairs, when you think of the millions worldwide with little or nothing
at all to eat. We bang on about obesity, food-miles, school dinners and buying
locally, but this is in another league. Putting on weight was probably a perfectly
natural tendency in prehistoric times – if you didn’t do it, you didn’t survive
the cold and shortages of winter. Spending your life in overheated buildings and
cars and persuading people to run marathons to compensate is a pretty wasteful
way of managing how much we like to eat today. Nor do I get too excited about
food-miles, so long as the food in question is grown with less fossil-fuel energy
than it takes to grow it here. As for school dinners, I seem to remember the
difficulty with kids was to persuade them to eat all their ‘greens’; I can’t see
teachers having the time to make them clear up their plates. Perhaps I’m old
fashioned but it used to be the parents’ job to see they got a good square meal
a day.
All this pales into insignificance if nearly a third of our food is wasted. Or
is it just that I’m a farmer, who thinking that I’m doing a worthwhile job of
producing the nations food, gets upset to find that people value it so poorly
that we can afford to throw so much away. Following that one news item, why
has nothing more been said about it or have I missed something? What is this
food that’s being discarded?
There are three obvious areas to look at. Are we leaving too much on our
plates which ends up in the household rubbish and thence to landfill? Long
gone are the days when that was taken care of through a pigsty at the back
of the dwelling, and even composting is now frowned on. There is certainly a
fair bit left on our plates and vegetable dishes in restaurants in these days of
increased eating out. And I’ve no doubt a lot of food is inevitably prepared in
catering establishments, which ends up being discarded as surplus. Following
foot and mouth, swill feeding to pigs, where catering waste should be used, is
now a thing of the past, although that valuable by-product did not cause the
disease - it was solely the result of badly enforced regulations. But of course,
the most obvious possible area of waste is the modern phenomenon of food that
is past its ‘sell by’ or ‘use by’ date. It used to be either bad or it wasn’t, and
your nose told you which, but would you dare put your face down in a Tesco
or Asda fish counter and take a sniff? And anyway most of the food in these
251

2005
splendid food-emporiums is wrapped up in unopenable plastic so that any slight
whiff is undetectable.
There is one bright side to all this. We are currently producing 74% of our
indigenous food ourselves and 63% of all our food. Come a world shortage, if
we stopped throwing any food away, we would be approximately self-sufficient.
That is if the next government doesn’t run down farming any further.

April 27th
Anguish of TB Reaction
Is it my imagination or are ticks much more common than they used to be?
Although I wear wellingtons with my trousers tucked well in when walking the
pastures to check the cattle, I have already this year found a tick firmly attached
to my person. I should think I get bitten about once a week through an average
summer. Removing a tick is not an easy task and can leave a very sore red
spot.
There is, however, a more serious side to this. Ticks can carry some pretty
nasty diseases to both humans and animals. Lyme disease, which is transmitted
by a tick found on deer, is becoming increasingly common in the southwest. It
can make one extremely ill if not diagnosed early, as two friends of mine have
recently experienced.
In my student days, we were taught about Red Water in cattle, a tick borne
infection that attacks the red blood cells causing anaemia, which can kill a cow
in days. It is not a disease that you hear much about now, and the suggested
method of control in those days was to stock the infected pastures with sheep
and kill off the disease-carrying ticks which attached to them in arsenic sheepdips. Many of us no longer dip our sheep, instead using a pour-on chemical to
control fly-strike, which may account for the increase in tick numbers.
My interest in the subject arises from a comment made by my old farming
friend, Paul Isaac. I was talking to him a few weeks ago about rabbit and
badger numbers in the early 1950s, when the very effective TB eradication
programme was getting into its stride. It was his opinion that ticks are now
part of the present TB problem. I don’t know what the scientific thinking is
on this, but it is certainly worth considering. Like TB, Lyme disease and Red
Water are bacterial diseases. They are both spread by tick-borne infection, and
can be picked up from and passed on to the two or three host animals that the
tick lives on through its life cycle of larva, nymph and adult stages. It seems
extremely probable, therefore, that TB can follow a similar path. Added to
that, I understand that the TB bacillus has already been found in ticks. It may
252

not be the only way in which the disease can pass between badgers, deer and
cattle, but since all three species are prone to ticks, it would indeed be a very
potent route for the infection to spread.
I mentioned a few weeks ago that we were due for our routine TB herd
test. With the escalating number of outbreaks in the region, we were naturally
worried. Well, the worst has occurred and we now join the many farmers with
whom we have only commiserated in the past, in the stress and misery that
dealing with this disease involves. After 50 years without ever having even a
single cow react to the test, we now have four. One, an in-calf Angus heifer will
be taken away for slaughter this week. Depending on her post mortem result,
the others, another heifer and two cows with young calves, will either follow or
be kept isolated for 60 days to be retested. The calves will not be slaughtered
whatever the result, but what we are supposed to do with them I don’t know.
Suckled calves do not take kindly to being switched to bucket rearing.
The heifer that is being slaughtered is home bred and spent last summer in
fields that are bounded by woodland on three sides and a lane on the fourth, so
there was no contact with outside cattle. She was housed through the winter
in the straw yards, so where has the infection come from?
It has been a very sad week for this farm. I can foresee that eventually a
widespread slaughter of badgers and deer will be inevitable in a belated attempt
to get TB under control. I had hoped that our cattle would still be free of the
disease when that day arrived, and that our badgers would therefore also be
spared, to be part of a future vaccination programme. But for us that time
has now passed. I put the blame firmly at the door of Dr Elaine King and the
badger protection societies for their misguided approach to the problem, which
has so influenced the public and politicians, and will so badly affect the very
animal they wish to protect.

May 4th
Now, If I Were the Prime Minister. . .
With a new government only a matter of days away, I have been reading some
of the lighthearted “if I were the Prime Minister” comments appearing in the
WMN. I confess I have never had much desire to get involved in politics, let
alone to live at No10. But I have always been ready to criticise Ministers of
Agriculture, and often to their face; in fact I can remember one or two really
quite angry confrontations. I have generally got home afterwards somewhat
embarrassed at myself, and wondering what I would do in their place. So I can
253

2005
certainly daydream about replacing Margaret Beckett as Secretary of State at
DEFRA.
I would begin rather negatively by getting rid of the five ministers responsible for many of the nonsensical decisions farmers have been suffering recently,
that is if the election hasn’t got rid of them for me. I suspect that ignorance
rather than malice has been behind their actions, so I would treat them kindly.
Margaret Beckett would be exiled to a caravan park in a wine-growing region
of Southern France. The farmers there have begun dynamiting government
buildings and vehicles for no very obvious reason. She could spend her declining years reflecting on her good fortune to have been the UK rather than the
French farm minister.
Elliot Morley is a keen bird watcher. I would him make responsible for
nature reserves nation wide, but with his headquarters in the Outer Hebrides.
He has been a minister for rural affairs since Labour came to power in 1997. I
accompanied him when he toured Devon that year as the then minister responsible for animal health to see what had to be done to combat TB in cattle. At
the end of that day he accepted the need to control the disease in our wildlife.
After eight years, I am sure the health of our wildlife now needs him more than
we do.
Alun Michael’s hobby is hill walking. He visited our hilly farm a few years
ago to view Jim’s newly planted woodland, and has been sending Jim a Christmas card each year since. I would reward him by sending him back to his
native Wales to take responsibility for the health and safety of the animal
rights brigade, with whom I have some sympathy, in their future role as the
quarry for Welsh drag hunts. Ben Bradshaw can return to his constituents in
Exeter. When newly elected as an MP, he professed to have no interest in farming whatsoever and with no farmers in his constituency, hadn’t any intention
of changing. Fate has played him a dirty trick and he deserves to be allowed
to return to relative obscurity, looking after his urban electorate. That leaves
me with Lord Whitty, whom I am fortunate enough never to have met. I can
only suggest he should be confined to the House of Lords until that Chamber
is abolished. It should keep him occupied for years to come.
Next, I would turn my attention to the senior civil servants in DEFRA, and
especially to the Sir Humphreys of this world, one of whom must be lurking
somewhere in the bowels of that department. There can be no one else capable
of designing the rules and cross compliance conditions for the new Single Farm
Payments Scheme, as applied in England, but not in Scotland or Wales. For
example, I want to find out how this was devised so that a farmer with 100
acres bounded by barbed wire and doing nothing at all in the way of cross
254

Jun 1st

Filling Forms Is Over

compliance, will be paid at exactly the same rate per acre as a neighbour,
farming a similar area but with smaller hedged fields, who will be managing
about two miles of hedgerow and using three per cent of his land to protect
the wildlife bordering it. I wonder if the government mandarin responsible has
ever put on a pair of wellies. I would have him (no woman could possibly be so
impractical) transferred to road transport. It will take a genius of his calibre
to unscramble that gridlock and having done so, he might get time to take his
first view of the real countryside.
Having dealt with the difficult part of the job, I would then turn to the easy
bits, like abolishing farm inspectors, compulsory set aside and tax on the farm
use of farm-produced biofuels; introducing payments to farmers for the time
spent reading ministry bumf; bringing back on-farm slaughter, etc. etc. – all
too much for a mere daydream.

June 1st
Filling Forms Is Over
Oh to be a farmer on a fine day towards the end of May. If I had to choose a
single day for time to stand still, this would be the one. Especially if there had
been some wet cold days through the month to stop spring rushing too quickly
into summer - for us this year has been nearly perfect. If you’re wondering why
I sound so glad to be alive, it may not be just that our hedges are awash with
cow parsley and campions, our meadows with buttercups and our woods with
bluebells. It could also be thanks to the end of the worst spell of form filling
that I can remember and because I’ve just recovered from a very nasty dose of
’flu.
At the beginning of May, to celebrate a milestone birthday, Jenny and I
took a five-day coach trip to Bruges in Belgium, a city that friends have often
encouraged us to visit. I confess I was not over impressed – we spend enough
time in my opinion reflecting on the horrors of the last war, but there they
seem to be permanently surrounded by the scars of the 1914-18 one. Perhaps it
was the theme of the coach trip, but everywhere seems to be connected to one
famous battlefield or another. It’s surprising how normal the farmland looks
today, but I couldn’t help visualising what Devon might now have looked like
had we suffered the scale of destruction that swept across that countryside 90
years ago.
Back home, a lot has happened in the intervening weeks. Our TB reactor
heifer did not show clinical signs of the disease on post-mortem and the other
three reactor cows have therefore had a stay of execution. Our next test is due
255

2005
in a fortnight, so a great deal hangs on that. A clear test would remove the
need for 60-day testing, which during the summer is a real headache. Unlike
dairy cows, our beef cattle do not return to the buildings on a daily basis and
bringing them in twice in a week for testing from the four corners of the farm is
very unsettling. They are normally only moved to pastures new, which at this
time of year doesn’t happen very often. However that is a small worry compared
with the possibility of repeated reactors showing up, which will confirm TB in
the environment, since we are a closed herd.
The timing of our holiday did have the fortunate effect of making me get
our Single Farm Payment application in to DEFRA well before the deadline;
I tend to leave ministry forms to the last minute. The hoo-ha over that formfilling episode seems to have died down somewhat, but farmers will not forget
in a hurry the shambles that DEFRA inflicted on the whole industry. I was
staggered to find, on returning home, that Margaret Beckett was still in charge
following the election. Clearly she is ultimately responsible for DEFRA’s shortcomings, and Blair should have grasped the opportunity to give her the boot.
Unfortunately, her rather fanciful ideas about how the new payments system
should operate in England, the hybrid system as it has come to be known, as
opposed to the much simpler systems adopted in Wales, Scotland and the rest
of Europe, may well come back to haunt us.
Already I see there are comments appearing in the broad sheets that landowning farmers in England will increasingly in future be paid for doing nothing.
Most farmers of my acquaintance, with rock bottom prices for their produce
and sky-high financial commitments, will certainly take exception to remarks
like that, particularly since we all made it clear at the outset that any scheme
should not allow rich incomers to buy land purely to milk the system.
Jim is doing what I expect most farmers will be doing in the circumstances
and using the payments over the next few years to make the changes needed
to continue farming. Having thought about it for some time now, he has taken
the plunge and gone organic. All the necessary form filling for that has been
completed and it wasn’t as bad as I’d been led to believe - perhaps it’s just
that we’re punch drunk with bureaucracy at the moment. We’ve also had our
organic inspection in the last few days and that also seems to have gone off
successfully. All that remains is to fill out one final set of forms, DEFRA’s
‘organic entry level scheme’, which we applied for over a month ago, and for
which we are still waiting.

Joy of Farm Diaries

Joy of Farm Diaries
“Milked morning and afternoon. Looking for cow along Clarks bottoms. 2
calves (1 dead). Carried 1 load from Big Bigabin” - a diary entry for 6th
October 1950. If you are lucky enough to have them, old family diaries make
fascinating reading. I have started browsing through a collection of pocket
diaries belonging to Jenny’s cousin, Michael Dennison. They were kept by his
father, Charlie, and cover the years he worked on the neighbouring farm from
1942 until he retired in 1967. Some of the early years are missing unfortunately
and those there are have entries that are very brief, with seven days to a page.
But from 1950 onwards, with a whole page for each day, Charlie had more room
to spread himself and it becomes a detailed history of the daily chores of a farm
worker on a typical mixed Devon farm. What makes it more interesting is the
fact that Charlie did not come from an agricultural background, was not even
a Devonian, but was a Londoner born and bred. His is an urban perspective
and it shows in the minutiae he records, which a countryman might well have
omitted as being obvious or unimportant.
How it all came about is quite a story in itself. The Dennisons lived in
Wood Green, north London, where Charlie was the foreman in charge of the
repair workshops of a factory making electrical goods. With the outbreak of
war, they found themselves increasingly threatened by the blitz. By September
1940, Charlie’s wife, Gertie, had written to Jenny’s mother to ask if there was
room at the farm for her and their two boys, John and Michael, to come down
to Devon to escape the bombing. Michael, the younger son, who was seven at
the time, remembers it clearly. Charlie saw them off by train from Paddington
on a Saturday morning, and my future father-in-law met them at Eggesford
station with a horse and trap late that day.
On the Saturday night exactly one week later, there was a knock on the
farmhouse door which opened to reveal Charlie standing on the threshold in
the dark. Apparently on the Wednesday evening following their departure,
their house had been totally demolished by a bomb. Charlie had been trapped
under the rubble in their Anderson shelter, where he remained until he was dug
out the next morning. Their furniture and belongings were gone, but Charlie
was unhurt and felt that, rather than writing, it was better to come and tell
them in person. He returned to London the following Monday to stay with
a brother-in-law and continued with his job at the factory until that too was
flattened twelve months later.
That was the end of life for Charlie in London, and he came down to Devon to
257

2005
join his family. He worked for some months on the family farm, but apparently
in the war you were only allowed to have one fulltime worker for every 50 acres.
Since my father-in-law already had a full staff, Charlie had to find a job. Luckily
there was a nominal vacancy on the neighbouring farm, where the old farmer
had just retired, handing over to his son, who was himself in his sixties. Better
still, there was a cottage available and Charlie and family made it their home
till he retired 25 years later.
It’s a pity the records of his first years as a farm worker haven’t survived
and I have only Michael’s memory to rely on. His father started by going to
work in waistcoat, tie and pinstriped trousers, exactly as he dressed for work
in London, except for the boots and gaiters. As a result, while Fred Salter, the
farmer, referred to the other more senior workers as Arthur, Sam and Harry,
he was addressed as Mr Dennison. Charlie’s appearance also seems to have
encouraged Salter to confide his worries that he had just paid his landlord
over the odds in buying the farm as a sitting tenant, not something you would
expect to divulge to a new employee. I doubt whether Charlie knew enough
about farming to assure him that £2500 seemed pretty reasonable for 270 good
acres even in those days.
I shall enjoy delving into the diaries at leisure; they are not something you
can read at a sitting. ‘Clarks bottoms’, where Charlie was searching for the
calving cow, are on our side of the boundary stream, and 1950 was the year
before I started farming here. As for the load of corn from Big Bigabin, what
a wet autumn it must have been, if they were still harvesting in October.

June 15th
Haymaking Before Silaging
For the first time that I can remember we’ve made hay before making any silage.
Whether Jim makes any silage at all this year will depend on what sort of a
summer we get from now on. We started silage making in 1955 when we first
employed a farm worker, and have made it every year since. In those early days
it required at least two people working together – one buckraking the mown
grass from the field and the other spreading it evenly on the clamp. The odd
shower of rain didn’t make too much difference to silage quality, but trying
to make good hay in a catchy season was a nightmare. The advent of forage
harvesters put the work force needed up to three people, and we have continued
like that, using contractors in the 1970s and more recently doing all the work
ourselves. Last year, Dave came back from retirement to give us a hand through
silage making, but this year Jim resolved to manage on his own by switching to
258

Jun 15th

Haymaking Before Silaging

wrapped silage bales or giant sheep droppings, as a townie once described them
when asking what they were.
The down side of wrapped bales is the contractor’s bill, something we can ill
afford just now with beef prices where they are. On the other hand there is the
ability to change your mind half way through the harvesting process and make
hay if the sun keeps on shining, as it did last week. Jim succeeded in getting a
couple of fields of very good hay baled up at the weekend, and all I was asked
to do was take over the wind-rowing for one half-hour spell while he had a bit
of lunch. With big bales and a front loader, I don’t see him needing much help
stacking the hay either, so it looks as if my leisure time is growing.
I took the opportunity to get off the farm on three occasions during the week,
something I’ve probably never done before during haymaking. I felt a bit guilty
really, but I expect I’ll get used to it. Jenny and I went to a Devon Wildlife
Trust walk at one of their nature reserves to see how they were managing the 35
acres of culm grassland. It is being actively managed to, in their words, improve
its biodiversity. With all the current interest in farm support payments being
directed towards the environment, I thought it might be a chance to see the
experts at work. Until a few years ago, it was a small farm that time had left
behind. The old farmer had kept a few cattle which grazed more or less where
they liked through the year, picking and choosing the best herbage as it came
into season. It was a little gem of a place on that summers evening, and we shall
certainly visit it again. There was even a cuckoo sitting in a bush watching us
as we watched it, the first I’ve seen for years. However the reserve is only like it
is because it has been farmed in a particular way that has long gone. I don’t see
how the Devon Trust can possibly improve its biodiversity; they will be hard
put to just maintain it by replicating the management of the old farmer, and
that will cost money.
Our second evening out was to Devon FWAGs AGM followed by an ELS
farm walk at the Munday Family farm near Crediton. This was well attended
and well worthwhile. Most of us are at present grappling with the intricacies
of this last of the form filling marathon we have been lumbered with by our
political masters this year. FWAG is exactly the right organisation to represent
farmers in this new age of environmental correctness, and it is about time
more of us became full members to give FWAG a bit more clout. At least our
present chairman provided Bill Oddie with an ideal farm for his TV nature
watch programme.
Our third trip off the farm was a very last minute decision to visit the Royal
Cornwall Show on Friday. It’s a fair old way and we didn’t leave till midmorning, but it is without question the best Agricultural Show of the lot, and
259

2005
I know I am being very disloyal to my home county when I say that. I was
even encouraged by Jenny to buy a new sofa at one of the stands, something
we’ve been contemplating for the last ten years. If I’m going to lounge around
through hay making in future, I may need it.

June 22nd
Hassle of TB Tests
Monday morning and an early start rounding up the cattle for our all-important
60-day TB re-test. You may remember that we had our first ever TB reactors
a couple of months ago, following which one heifer was slaughtered and three
animals were left in isolation pending the post-mortem result. So far that has
proved negative, so Thursday will be the day of judgement when the vet returns
and we get all the cattle in again to check for any reaction to the tuberculin
jabs. We could do without this hassle at the moment - with fine weather, Jim
is back to haymaking.
On a brighter note, Bev seems to be having a good year with the ewe flock.
Shearing was quickly done on a cool calm evening, without the mini-hurricane
we had to contend with a year ago, and half the lambs have already gone for
slaughter at a price that is 10% up on last year. That at least replaces the ewe
subsidy that is now a distant memory. The lambs are grading well and averaging
20 kilos off just mothers milk and grass at about 14 weeks old, without worm
drenches or vaccines, which is pretty satisfactory. Not that anything will change
next year now that we are officially organic, so long as the spring grass grows as
well without the small dressing of nitrogen fertilizer that we have always used.
We can start selling lambs as organic after May 2007, but if they take longer to
fatten, they may not taste as sweet.
Unfortunately, unlike lamb, beef prices do not seem to have risen. We sent
four heifers off for slaughter last week; they weighed and graded well but we shall
receive almost exactly the same price from the abattoir as we got for similar
heifers last June. As any additional slaughter premium on them has now ceased,
they will end up making £50 a head less. There was very little profit in sucklers
even with production subsidies, so unless the trade is prepared to raise the price,
the future for cattle farming here doesn’t look very rosy. TB may well be the
final straw. That makes little sense in a region ideally suited to beef production
in a Europe that is currently importing beef from all over the world to make up
a shortfall.
What makes the present situation even more bizarre is something Jim was
told following a recent visit to his arable-farming cousins in Hertfordshire. Ap260

Jun 29th

Getting in Our Good Hay

parently they are selling their feed-wheat at the dismal price of £65 a tonne for
export to beef feedlots in Western Australia. Admittedly it is being transported
partly as ballast, but some of the resulting beef is no doubt returning back here.
If that isn’t food miles, I don’t know what is.
None of this is really surprising when you hear Blair arguing with Chirac over
Britain’s budget rebate. I am all for him trying to give the French President a
bloody nose, but I would prefer it if our own Prime Minister at least understood
after all these years how the CAP operated. To suggest that there is any
connection between our rebate, which I thought originally derived from the level
of our VAT returns relative to the rest of Europe, and an agricultural policy
that is supposedly applied equally to all member states, is, to use Chirac’s
word, pathetic. Of course French farming gets twice as much as we do – it’s
area of farmland is double ours. The individual farmers get exactly the same,
depending on the size of their farms. Or at least they should do, depending on
how much support they get from the coffers of their own governments, which is
perhaps where the French do rather well.
Isn’t Blair aware that the present CAP has already been reformed in 2003,
with the UK’s full agreement, or didn’t his secretary of state, Margaret Beckett,
bother to explain it to him? This will last until 2013, with the EU’s agriculture
budget reduced during that time by 15% of the commission’s original proposal.
How much further does he want to damage Europe’s food producing ability in
the light of his determination to bring the subject of global warming to the
top of the agenda at the forthcoming G8 summit? He may well see farmers as
an unimportant 5% of Europe’s population, but they will certainly be needed
when the first effects of global warming become apparent – a shortage of food
worldwide.

June 29th
Getting in Our Good Hay
I woke to the crack of lightening at about half past two early last Friday morning.
In a perverse sort of way, I quite enjoyed lying in bed listening to the violent
thunderstorm and rain that followed. It can’t have been much fun for people
whose houses were struck or who found themselves flooded when dawn broke,
but the two fields of hay that Jim had been busy with all week were baled and
safely in the barn.
In the good old slow days of making hayricks, and I can remember them
well, that first-class hay would have been soaked, repeatedly tedded in the days
following to dry out, and just possibly by now gathered in, but with the quality,
261

2005
or nature as it’s called, gone out of it. As it was, Jim had the second half of
our TB test to do on the Thursday morning, get the hay windrowed for our
contractor to bale in the afternoon, and spend the evening putting the resulting
85 big bales under cover. Thank goodness we now make hay in big bales. A year
or two back, that would have been nearly 2000 small bales, which even with time
for us to stand them up, would have got pretty damp. With the storm forecast
and using tractor headlights, Jim plugged on and finished around midnight. If
he got little sleep as the thunder rolled overhead for the rest of the night, at
least he beat the weather and is benefiting from the rain that we always need
at this time of year. It will also help make up for the disappointment that, as
a result of the TB test, another in-calf Angus heifer has been earmarked for
slaughtered.
With the laboratory results on our first reactor finalised - the culture on the
tissue samples coming back negative - it does look as if that heifer never actually
contracted TB at all. As the ministry’s letter puts it “such reactor animals have
frequently had contact with tuberculosis and react to the tuberculin test as a
result”. Is it possible that the heifer might now have been immune to TB as
she grew older– a form of natural vaccination? If so, what a waste of a really
nice young suckler to replace one of our older cows, all of which will have to be
slaughtered before their time if the ‘Over Thirty Month Scheme’ is closed this
autumn.
We have 25 homebred Angus heifers being reared specially to replace these
older cows. Normally we would not keep as many replacements in any one
year, but times are anything but normal. Like every other beef farmer, we are
anxious to see an end to good mature beef being incinerated just because it has
reached an arbitrary age limit. But it will mean having to cull 46 of our herd
of 55 suckler cows over the next three years and that’s a lot of animals to lose.
They will take a bit of replacing in view of our policy of never buying in cattle
except the occasional stock bull. As things stand, we shall be down to under
40 cows by 2008.
So you can see the last thing we want now is to be slaughtering Angus heifers
unnecessarily. And unfortunately that is exactly what seems to be happening.
As well as the heifer that was already in isolation, and is now for the chop,
another one has reacted as a possible and has joined what I can only describe
as ‘death row’. If this depressing sequence of events continues every 60 days
and the vets don’t actually find any of our animals with the disease, we have to
assume that something with TB is out there on the farm causing the apparent
infection. As Jim remarked, it is a damn shame we can’t just vaccinate the
whole herd at our own expense on a routine basis and get on with our lives,
262

Jul 6th

Mapping Out Trees

which after all these years is exactly what we should be doing – no herd tests,
no slaughtering, and no need for compensation. And leave the wildlife to get
on with theirs.
Talking of wildlife and going back to hay making, Jim has been stacking
the hay bales in one of the cattle yard feed passages. We’ve had an owl-box
hung up in the barn normally used for storing hay and straw, and our barn owls
have decided to switch to it this year from their usual box next to our house.
Both parents are actively feeding young, and although the hay will have to be
transferred eventually, Jim felt they should be undisturbed for the time being.

July 6th
Mapping Out Trees
There are 135 trees on this farm. I am talking about large individual trees, in
our case mostly oak and ash, which are to be found on hedgerows or out in the
middle of fields. There are actually many more trees than that but we gave up
counting when we reached this figure – it seemed such a waste of time. With
woodlands and shelterbelts, we must have thousands of trees. Why DEFRA
require this particular bit of information I have yet to fathom. It is one of the
items that we have had to include on our ‘farm environmental record’ maps
when applying for the Entry Level Stewardship Scheme.
In fact there is a whole lot about this scheme that I find rather peculiar.
The concept is very laudable – a voluntary scheme to reward farmers for looking
after the countryside. If we’ve been doing that already, there should be little
difficulty in qualifying. If not, there are a number of alternative management
options we can adopt to be entitled to the annual payment. You would expect it
to be quite easy to devise a simple scheme to achieve this. But oh, no! Someone
somewhere in DEFRA decided this was too good an opportunity to miss and
has added another load of red tape to the already groaning desks of the farming
community.
In our case, the scheme was not exactly voluntary. In the past, there has
been government support available to help farmers through the transition period
of converting to organic production – the three or four years during which the
farm is shedding any traces of the chemical residues of normal farming, with
crops and livestock still being marketed as non-organic. From this year for
some unknown reason this support has been linked to the new environmental
payments. So we had no option but to apply, although we are already half way
263

2005
through an old ten-year stewardship scheme, which we must complete and keep
separate.
Since registering the farm as organic, we were anxious to start the transition
period as soon as possible. Like many farmers, we had considerable difficulty
getting the application forms, but thanks to the efforts of the snowed-under
DEFRA officials at Bristol, the papers arrived at the eleventh hour, and we
just caught the deadline of July 1st.
Now that it is over, I am struck by some of the odder aspects of the whole
exercise. We were in such a hurry to get the job done, for which we employed
FWAG’s help, that it wasn’t so obvious at the time. The scheme appears to have
been devised as some giant board game. For a start, a successful application
depends on accumulating the right number of points. The first move in the
game is to calculate how many points you need for the size of your farm - 30
points per hectare. An organic farm requires 60 points a hectare. Simple so far.
The next move is looking at the various options to earn the necessary points.
The first option is obligatory – complete your maps (we had five of these)
showing all the environmental features of the farm – hedges, trees, ponds, woods
etc. For this you earn three of the points needed towards your total of 30
points per hectare. Here it dawns on you that the dead hand of bureaucracy is
manifesting itself. If you have to complete the maps, why award three points?
Why not just reduce the target to 27 points? There is more of this to follow.
An organic farm automatically gets 30 points towards the 60 needed, just for
completing an extra column of figures. Why not skip the column and leave the
target at 30 points like everyone else?
The rest of the game consists of trawling through pages of options to pick
which might suit your own farm, or better still, which are already part of your
farming system. Here again, there seems to be a strong bias in favour of the
organic farmer. For example, why should a conventional farmer get 100 points
per hectare less than his organic neighbour for growing a pollen and nectar
flower mixture. I think he deserves more.
Finally, like any good board game, there are penalties for breaking the rules.
You know the sort of thing – “go directly to jail, do not pass ‘go’, do not collect
£200”. In this game the only excuse is called ‘Force majeure’. I hope that
covers a hurricane knocking over the 135 trees DEFRA has made us show on
our maps.

Woodfair Better Than Ever

July 13th
Woodfair Better Than Ever
Walking round the cattle early this morning, I couldn’t help noticing how flourishing the bramble blossom is on some of our hedgebanks, a blanket of colour
with the individual flowers larger than usual. It is obviously going to be a blackberry year. It’s remarkable how often each year’s prevailing weather produces
an explosion of one particular wild berry or fruit, nut or seed, far in excess of
nature’s ability to benefit from the surplus.
It seems not to be just the amount of summer rainfall that makes the difference, but rather the timing of what we get that has the most effect. Certainly
this summer has not been a particularly wet one and yet we’ve probably had
one of the best grass growing seasons I can remember. Our steepest pastures,
which are normally going brown by now, are still keeping up with the cows, and
the aftermaths, following haymaking, have recovered much faster than usual.
Of course if this present heat wave continues, it’s not too late for the grass to
frizzle, but the prospect of a repeat of 1976 is surely behind us. We are just
beginning the long slide into autumn, with the yields of our corn crops now
fixed and dependant on the weather at harvest time.
My attention to rainfall was triggered at the weekend by an interview on TV
with a Portuguese cattle farmer standing in a barren landscape and not a blade
of grass to be seen. He did not expect to be able to continue keeping cattle and
were he a young man, he would undoubtedly pack it in straightaway and get a
job. Portugal is experiencing a terrible drought, which has not been equalled
since records began: reservoirs drying up and weather forecasts replaced by
forest fire warnings. I realize this is in one of the drier regions of Europe, but is
this just a normal weather fluctuation that won’t be repeated in living memory
or a sign of things to come?
There was another illuminating piece of TV a few weeks back, which outlined
the areas that would be flooded in Britain following the various scenarios of
rising sea levels. It indicated the coastal cities that would be inundated, and
the availability of habitable land for the displaced population, but not a mention
of the loss of huge areas of prime farmland in all the major river valleys. The
productivity of this land is nowhere near so vulnerable to rainfall levels, as we
are here, higher up, where dry summers are a real worry.
Setting off last Saturday for what for us has become a not-to-be-missed visit
to South West Forest’s annual Woodfair, I confess that much of its attraction is
its location at Roadford Reservoir. This is developing into one of the finest lakes
in the South West. The Woodfair, now in its fifth year, was, if that’s possible,
265

2005
better than ever. More exhibitors, many more people, and a glorious day; the
only complaint can have been the length of the ice-cream queues. It is fast
becoming more than a Woodfair, rather a celebration of the non-agricultural
part of rural life in Devon and Cornwall.
When the legs start to tire, there is always the prospect of sitting on the
grass, listening to the band and watching the small red-sailed boats tacking to
and fro in the breeze generated by such a large stretch of water. It’s the level of
that water, our drinking water, which is always the first thing I look for when
we arrive. It was virtually full last Saturday, which is immeasurably more than
can be said for the reservoirs in Portugal, and is equivalent to living on another
planet compared for many in Africa, who have no proper drinking water at all.
I am reminded of this every year when I visit the stand of old farming
friends of ours, Viv and Graham England. They are there to raise money for
their small charity, Devon Aid-Korogwe, which they set up ten years ago to
provide clean drinking water to replace what is often just a contaminated water
hole for villages in the Korogwe District in Tanzania. They have been going
out each year for a few weeks to oversee the installation of new wells and piped
supplies in partnership with the villagers, who pay a small percentage of the
cost and therefore take a real interest in making the projects succeed. Viv and
Graham are doing more to make poverty history than most people I know.

Ignorance of Our Premier
We have managed over the years to keep our tractors and machinery going to
a ripe old age. That’s not to say we haven’t spent a bit on maintenance and
repairs, but the last time we bought a new tractor was in 1977 when we had an
expanding dairy herd, and an expanding overdraft to match. I lashed out on a
new Czech Zetor, the cheapest make of tractor then on the market. We have
used it less and less recently and Jim let it go to a farm in a neighbouring parish
while it was still running. If that sounds like pensioning off the old carthorse, I
certainly felt a little nostalgic as I saw it drive away up our lane.
Jim has also just replaced one of our two other tractors, which although still
in full working order, was even older than the Zetor. 18 years ago he bought
a second-hand 12-year-old Ford that is now also nearing the end of its useful
life. He traded it in for a newer model, a modest ten-year old this time, which
will hopefully see him through the next 18 years. I’m told the old Ford will end
its days on some African farm where many of our worn-out European tractors
manage to eke out a few more seasons; it is surprising what a resourceful African
266

Jul 20th

Ignorance of Our Premier

mechanic can do with elastic bands and sticking plaster without a health and
safety inspector breathing down his neck. If Blair and Brown get their way, our
future food supply may well depend on it.
I am more than a little fed up by the continuing emphasis on farm subsidies
as being the main cause of world poverty. There seems to be a theory that
fair trade, whatever that means, will solve Africa’s problems overnight. Meanwhile, as a farmer, I am made to feel guilty that I am taking taxpayers money
while starving millions are unable to sell their surplus food to our overstocked
supermarkets.
Farm subsidies have always been a sore subject with urban politicians. Tony
Blair set off this particular round of national breast-beating for quite the wrong
reasons. He questioned why farmers – a mere five percent of the working population – should be paid subsidies for producing food valued at only two percent
of GDP. Obviously if food was worth five percent of GDP in direct proportion
to the number of people producing it, a not unreasonable value to guarantee a
supply, all farm support would be superfluous. At two percent of GDP, food is
worth less than half the average value of all other forms of production. I don’t
exactly know how the figure for GDP is arrived at, but even if it includes the
salaries of politicians, civil servants, and the money men jacking up the average
of us lesser mortals working in field and factory, the value attributed to food is
abysmal.
The Prime Minister deplores spending as much as one half of one percent of
GDP, currently the total budget of the CAP, as a subsidy to farm-gate prices.
Even that addition only raised the average cost of food production to just half
the average value of every thing else produced in Europe. He may not have
intended it, but he seems to have proved how extraordinarily well farmers have
served the nation in holding down food prices since subsidies were introduced
after the war. I suppose it is the result of keeping us on a very short rope, so
that we have had to run faster or, more controversially, get bigger to stay in
business.
In fact, Blair appears not to know that the CAP is already changing to a
Common Environmental Policy. Food security is being thrown overboard and
anything that we are unable to produce cheaply in Europe will be imported on
the rather dubious premise of helping the third world. It rather flies in the face of
solving the other problem that the G8 summit left largely unresolved – climate
change. It will only take two consecutive years of failed harvests worldwide
for our elected leaders to start panicking. They are not usually much good at
reviving a neglected agriculture in an emergency. A classic example occurred in
the autumn of 1917, when a notice was received by farmers in Devon instructing
267

2005
them to increase the production of corn and potatoes. Every farm was ordered
to have exactly 30 percent of their land under the plough regardless of its
suitability, no more, no less. Some moorland farms only achieved their target
by ploughing such poor land that the crop was of less value than the seed put
in.

Just What Is in Fact a Real Family Farm
The Prince of Wales made a remark last week that rather stuck in my throat.
He was visiting a hill farm during a three-day tour of Wales and is reported as
saying that he had been reminded how profoundly he believed in the importance
of family farms, although it didn’t matter if some were less efficient than others,
as all contributed to the quality of rural life. Now, I know he has an impossible
job saying all the right things to people on these occasions, and he may have been
misquoted, but it was a little unfortunate that the farm he was on happened to
be owned by the President of the Farmers Union of Wales.
Prince Charles is one of the most supportive public figures for the beleaguered farming industry and I’m sure the FUW President doesn’t give a damn
if his farming looks a bit substandard, but that’s not what bothers me. It is the
almost universally accepted assumption that it is the “small family farm”, which
is under particular threat, and that it’s demise would be a national tragedy. I
just don’t believe it.
It was with that in mind that I went along to the Farmers Question Time
organised by Land Heritage last Friday evening. I confess I don’t know much
about Land Heritage beyond their literature, but I gather the Trust is a national
charity promoting organic farming, which is now focusing on halting the decline
in the number of small independent family farms. Unfortunately, I came away
little the wiser, as the answer to how this might be achieved never arose. In
fact my question, had there been time to pose it, would have queried whether,
as we were discussing the future of British farming, this was the right moment
to attempt to reverse a natural process that has been going on for centuries.
Pippa Woods, representing the Family Farms Association on the panel,
summed it up for me beautifully when she described life on a small family
farm as “Milking the cows first thing in the morning, doing the farm work all
day long, and then milking the cows again last thing at night”. Don’t I know
it? But for many of us it was just the first step on a ladder. Most of us hoped
to progress to a larger family farm by the time we reached middle age, with
268

Aug 3rd

Memories of Fairs of Old

a one or two of the more ambitious among us aspiring to a farming-business
empire to pass on to the next generation.
I’m not suggesting there’s anything wrong with staying on the bottom step
of that ladder, if you’re happy with that life, but there is surely nothing so intrinsically good about it that society should fund it. Better for the environment
– who says? We ourselves were so busy when we started, we hardly had time
to notice the environment, let alone do anything to improve it. If Jenny hadn’t
restrained me at the time, I would probably have knocked down more hedges to
try and make the farm viable than I actually did. It was only when we acquired
more land that I felt less inclined to push every acre to the limit.
Do small family farms produce better quality food or better animal welfare?
I don’t see why, unless they develop some speciality product the public will pay
over the odds for, in which case they will probably come through the present
recession better than the rest of us. Just producing basic foodstuffs on a small
scale must, when times are hard, encourage intensification.
As for the ‘family’ bit – all farming involves family in one way or another,
like any business that works from home. It’s a great way to bring up a family
if you aren’t too stressed to enjoy it – but the bigger the farm the better. A
small family farm surely puts undue pressure on youngsters to help with the
work, and even pushes them into eventually choosing the wrong career. Become
a farmer by all means, but not just because your parents need you. Hopefully
those days are past, and I certainly wouldn’t want to do anything to prolong
them.
So what about the situation for small family farmers now? Well, as Anthony
Gibson, another member of the ‘Any Questions Panel’, so succinctly put it, the
future’s looking bright if you’re short of land. There will be plenty out there
looking for someone to farm it at next to no-rent, when the single farm payment
scheme gets going. If you’ve got a house and a few acres as a base, you’ll be
sitting pretty.

August 3rd
Memories of Fairs of Old
“The Fair continued through both world wars and in 1943 over 1000 sheep and
300 bullocks were sold in the streets of Chulmleigh. With so many animals
pressed into New Street, Mr Charlie Western was unable to open his shoe shop
door” - an extract from newspaper reports of years past in last week’s programme of events for Chumleigh Old Fair. It conjures up a scene that used
to occur annually in towns and villages up and down old England. Every pub
269

2005
around here probably has a photo of a local fair with the farmers smiling at
the camera as they stand nonchalantly among a great throng of curling-horned
Devon bullocks, with shops and buildings forming an enclosure round them. I
regret that I started farming too late to have firsthand experience of how these
sales were actually conducted, but talking to older farmers, I can form a pretty
good idea of what went on.
Getting a bunch of cattle or sheep to the sale early in the morning would
have been relatively easy. Animals were used to walking long distances between
farms in those days and there were many more workers to accompany them.
Even the dogs seemed to know to run ahead and lie in open gateways. Also the
cattle were probably much tamer, which may surprise today’s farmers, who have
never had to clasp their animals round the neck on a daily basis to chain them
up in the sheds and shippens where they spent half their lives. And that was
not just the milking cows – the fattening cattle were also kept tied up in stalls
through the winter on many farms, instead of loose in straw yards of today.
That much I do remember, having often helped drive cattle and sheep from
farm to farm as a boy in Sussex. The circus that must have gone on after you
arrived at the sale I find harder to imagine. How on earth did you keep your
animals separate from all the others? And if they got mixed up, how did you
recognise them quickly enough to sort them out? No ear tags then and one
Devon bullock looks very much like another. Apparently the trick was to get
there early and hold your animals together at the edge of the gathering, until
it was their turn to be sold.
It’s what happened after they were sold that does surprise me. I am told
that at the end of the day you took your animals all the way home again,
hopefully arriving with just your own. It often wasn’t till then that a wrong
’un was noticed, and back it had to go. Apparently the dealer who’d bought
them needed time to make arrangements to have them moved to where ever
up country he had a sale for them, and they could remain on your farm for as
long as a fortnight. Eventually you set out again with your cattle or sheep to
the nearest railway station, from where they travelled onwards in style in cattle
trucks. That is from the 1850s when the railways reached Devon. Before then,
I presume drovers would have been the order of the day and the miles that farm
animals walked during their short lives must have been phenomenal.
The advent of cattle lorries put paid to that whole way of life and, like
the horns on cattle, these local selling fairs have now mostly disappeared. They
have been replaced by one-day agricultural shows, which fulfil the function of an
annual farming get together, but without the essential sale within easy walking
distance of every farm.

Lunacy of Stock Scheme

However Chulmleigh, here in North Devon, is rather special. It is one of
the few places to have continued holding an annual fair regularly through the
centuries, since the granting of its Royal Charter in 1253. The selling of sheep
and cattle ended in the 1980s, but a sheep show continues to be one of the
regular events to keep the connection with farm livestock. What the citizens of
Chulmleigh from 700 years ago would think of the fair now, I can only surmise.
Would they enjoy the four days of continuous jollity, with processions, feasting,
music, street entertainments and general carousing – undoubtedly! The sports
day on the playing field would certainly be familiar, and even the Golf Club
competitions might have some faint echoes from the past, but they would be
astounded at the variety of all the other activities that go on these days. If
you’ve never been, there’s always next year and, I’ve no doubt, 700 years after
that.

August 10th
Lunacy of Stock Scheme
It has often crossed my mind during the last twelve months that I would thoroughly enjoy being trapped in a lift for a couple of hours with Margaret Beckett.
Don’t get me wrong – I am the most chivalrous of men. The only indignity I
would inflict on her would be to bend her ear. What has brought on this unlikely
daydream just now is the latest example of DEFRA’s dead-handed bureaucracy,
which we’ve discovered to our cost.
In explaining this, I shall have to eat some words I wrote in this column
last February. It was a piece about the burial ban, in which I was extolling the
merits of the newly formed National Fallen Stock Company (NFSCo). We had
joined, following a meeting I attended in Exeter, where the various concerns
that farmers were raising at the time seemed to be adequately covered. I was
satisfied that there was no immediate possibility that costs would rise to swallow
up the Government’s 30 per cent funding or that the knackers would be able
to take advantage of the system and charge exorbitant prices for collecting and
incinerating dead farm animals.
How wrong I was. The first invoice we received in April was straight forward
enough, with the 30 per cent government contribution correctly deducted. And
the next invoice for May came with the welcome news that the Government had
increased its contribution to 50 per cent. However the actual invoice looked
decidedly odd. We had lost one ewe and one half grown lamb on different
occasions. The bill for the ewe was £23 minus £11.50 for the government
contribution. The bill for the lamb was £3 plus £16 to make up a minimum
271

2005
collection charge of £19, as specified in our knackers’ price list supplied by
NFSCo. But the government contribution in this case was just £1.50, with
nothing towards the £16 top up fee. In effect, we had to pay £11.50 to dispose
of the ewe, and the exorbitant price of £17.50 to get rid of the lamb.
Assuming that there was a mistake in the invoice, I rang the NFSCo helpline.
I can understand the need for a minimum charge to collect the individual smaller
carcass, but naively assumed this would also be covered by government support,
since it is shown in all the price schedules of the various knacker businesses that
we are authorised to use in this region. The helpline was no help. I was assured
we had been correctly invoiced, but I had the feeling that my complaint was
not really understood. I was, at least, given the name and phone number of the
DEFRA official, who represents the Government on the board of NFSCo.
I got through without difficulty to DEFRA in Page Street, Whitehall, but
could hardly believe it when I was told that I was the first person to bring this
obvious anomaly to their attention. It would be considered at the next Board
meeting. I have phoned since, and gather that nothing has changed.
If anything, the situation is now worse. We have had a new price schedule
taking effect from June, in which the minimum collection fees have increased,
in our local knackers case to £25, but with the charge for a half-grown lamb
reduced to £2. This means that the bill for such an animal has effectively risen
from £17.50 to £24, since we joined the scheme. Of course, if we happen to
loose thirteen lambs all at once, the bill for the whole lot would only be £13 –
half of £26 – since the Government’s 50 per cent contribution would then be
paid correctly. I have probably lost you, but no matter; we seem to be living in
a madhouse.
We have lost one more part-grown lamb since then, but Jim was not about
to be charged silly money again, and decided to take the carcass by car to the
incinerator site himself. Apart from the lingering smell and the time wasted,
that looked to be the answer, but when I rang the next day to see what the bill
would be, I discovered that, yes you’ve guessed it, there was a standing charge
of £10 for opening the site gates. And no government discount on that either.
If that item is on the bill when we eventually get it next month, I’ll be back on
the phone to Page Street. So you can see why I would like that couple hours
alone with Mrs Beckett. She is supposedly responsible for the decisions of her
Department. A well-dead lamb in the lift with us might even give her pause for
thought.

Organic Problems With Charlock

August 17th
Organic Problems With Charlock
We are four months along the road, and so far the going has been comparatively
easy. I am referring to our transition from farming conventionally to farming
organically. Years ago that would have been an odd thing to say - changing
from ‘intensive’ to ‘organic’ farming might have made sense, but the word ‘conventional’ would hardly have figured. ‘Going organic’ was generally understood
by farmers to mean giving up the use of bag nitrogen. Most of the synthetic
chemicals around on farms now hadn’t been invented.
In the 1950s, there were plenty of older farmers keen to warn us younger
chaps that slapping on soluble nitrogen would pull the heart out of our ground
and bankrupt us. I remember being told about a tenant farmer in the parish
having his farm sold over his head to a neighbour. Aggrieved, he demanded
to know why, seeing he had made a better offer. His one-time landlord apparently took great pleasure in telling him that he knew all about his night time
activities - spreading nitrogen after dark to avoid being caught breaking his tenancy agreement. He was not about to sell the farm to someone so determined
to impoverish the land. That was 100 years ago, and here we are only now
abandoning such a reprehensible practice. Not that I feel guilty about the way
we’ve farmed - I reckon our land is in much better heart today than it was when
I started. I’d like to be around to see how its fertility alters, if no inorganic
nitrogen is applied over the next 20 years and, more importantly perhaps, get a
look at the farm’s bank balance. If that hasn’t improved I doubt whether this
land will still be farmed.
Going organic hasn’t posed any problems to date in the management of the
livestock. We’ve actually saved some money by not buying any feed minerals.
In the past, the cattle and sheep have had general-purpose mineral licks always
on offer, as an insurance against deficiencies, but such slaphappy methods of
keeping our stock healthy is not allowed. In future we shall have to prove
a particular mineral is lacking, before remedying it. How much the contents
of our farm medicine cabinet will change, we’ve yet to find out. Before the
advent of antibiotics and modern wormers, it contained little that was any
more dangerous than the chemicals in today’s household cleaning agents. Farm
livestock were often dosed with either innocuous ‘brown drench’ type patent
medicines, probably more suitable as hangover cures for the farmer than pickme-ups for his recumbent cows, or mild poisons just about capable of killing
the animals, if used to excess, rather than the parasites they were harbouring.
Thankfully, we haven’t seen the vet on the farm all summer except to do
273

2005
the wretched TB tests, the third since April being due this week. Jim is aiming
to start corn harvesting but having to get the cattle back to the buildings on
two separate days will be no help at all.
As for the harvest, very fortunately one chemical that we’ve used for many
years is allowed under organic rules. The application of propionic acid (Propcorn) to the grain has been a simple treatment to prevent overheating, mould
and insect pests, and has meant that we have never needed to dry corn in difficult seasons. It also has the added advantage of preventing the germination of
any weed seeds that may be inadvertently recycled back onto the land through
the dung spreader, which is particularly relevant this year. Our triticale crop
has suffered with more charlock than we could pull by hand. In past years we
would have called in our spraying contractor, but this time we shut our eyes to
it. I believe the old remedies that would conform to organic principles were to
spray with a weak solution of copper sulphate, or use finely ground kainit as a
powder treatment, but neither was selective and both involved damage to the
crop. I doubt we have the knowledge to use them successfully today. Our other
weed problem is a horrible infestation of red shank in a field of under-sown
spring barley. Not an easy weed to get rid of at the best of times, and how
to deal with that organically is a puzzle. But at least any seed from these two
pernicious weeds, harvested with the grain, will be prevented from building up
a problem for the future.
We now need some prolonged hot weather until the middle of September.

August 24th
Best of Summer – So Far
Farmers are well known for never admitting that things are going right on
the farm. They may boast among themselves about their corn or milk yields,
but are normally much happier whingeing about those two inescapable farming
afflictions, the government and the weather. So I realize its tempting fate when
I describe our last week as the best of the summer so far. You may recall that
we were due for our third 60-day TB test; that Jim was hoping, rain permitting,
to start the corn harvest; and that I was having a gripe about the cost of having
dead animals collected for incineration.
We got through the TB test with hardly a hiccup, the cattle going through
the cattle-crush on the two days as if trained to it, which I suppose they now
are. Better still, they shouldn’t have to go through the crush again for another
six months, as we had a clear test. We have yet to be notified officially, but
it now seems possible that none of our cows actually contracted the disease,
274

Aug 24th

Best of Summer – So Far

although they were obviously challenged by the presence of TB somewhere on
the farm. It’s unfortunate that we lost two in-calf Angus heifers, but at least
the other three possible reactors are now out of isolation and back with the
herd. While I hesitate to count chickens, if we get through the next test all
clear in February, we can count ourselves extremely lucky by comparison with
the many farms in the South West that are plagued with TB for years on end.
I wrote the other week about the Government’s decision to make no contribution towards the minimum collection charge imposed by the knackers for
picking up the odd smaller casualty, which was proving outrageously unfair
to sheep producers like ourselves. Our complaint was surprisingly resolved last
Thursday, when I received a phone call from Michael Seals, Chairman of the National Fallen Stock Company, telling me that from September the Government’s
50% contribution towards the scheme would include this collection charge. As
Anthony Gibson said in his column last week, don’t be afraid to complain.
Our corn harvest did get under way in the intervals of TB testing. The
triticale was combined on the Tuesday and successfully dressed with Propcorn,
using a new applicator which Jim felt we needed if we are to continue growing
corn for our own use. Our old applicator is long gone, and we’ve been using a
homemade ‘Heath Robinson’ set up for the last few years, but with Soil Association Inspectors hovering in the background, a proper applicator seemed called
for. Surprisingly, one for straight corn is no longer manufactured; the only ones
available are for whole crop harvesting, with a much faster flow rate. I can’t
believe we are the last farmers left using propionic acid for feed corn; it’s too
good a practice to be consigned to the history books yet. The triticale straw,
nearly as valuable to us as the grain, was due to be baled late on the Thursday afternoon, but our contractor was unable to get to us until the following
morning. Heavy rain was forecast overnight, but in the event even the weather
was on our side and we got little more than a heavy dew. The straw was baled
under a hot sun at the best of the day, and is safely in the barn. So you can
see why we had a good week.
With a good take of grass seeds growing up through it, and the red shank
very much in evidence, Jim is still considering the best way of cutting our spring
barley, the only crop left to get in this year. Straight combining looks inevitable,
although it will produce a very dirty sample mixed with unripe red shank seed,
which may prove too much even for Propcorn to deal with. And the straw will
need a heat wave to save. Going back to the days of using a binder would also be
useless even if one was available, but the one method of harvesting which would
have worked is sitting in the barley field completely invisible under a shroud of
blackberry-rich brambles. It is the old Massey Harris bagging combine that my
275

2005
brother-in-law bought in 1950, and used successfully through many harvests
until it was retired to a corner under the hedge. It had the one advantage
over the modern combine, which we could do with today. A grain cleaner was
incorporated above the bagging platform, separating the clean corn from the
tailings and the weed seeds.

August 31st
Shut the Gate
I watched with some astonishment a short clip on local TV at the weekend
about the new areas of public access that have just been opened across the region. The interviewer was talking to Kate Ashbrook and a local farmer, standing
in front of a gateway and stile with Dartmoor spread out in the background.
Miss Ashbrook, as the general secretary of the Open Spaces Society, president
of the Dartmoor Preservation Association and chairman of the Ramblers’ Association’s Access Committee, was rather obviously expressing her pleasure at
the new places for her members to explore. The farmer, also rather predictably
in his turn, pointed out the swinging gate behind them, which had not been
properly closed. Much of the land in Devon and Cornwall that has now been
opened to the public does indeed need grazing livestock to keep it walkable, so
he had a valid point. He was, after all, responsible if his animals strayed onto
the highway. What a wonderful opportunity, I thought, for Miss Ashbrook to
enlighten us about what her many organisations were doing to make the public
fully aware of their responsibilities under the new access arrangements. But, no
– she told the farmer that, since there was a stile for walkers to gain access, he
should padlock his gate!
Kate Ashbrook telling a farmer to padlock a gate – I could hardly believe
my ears. What about people who might have difficulty climbing a stile, but are
still active enough to enjoy walking? What about the farmer, who arrives to
find that a bullock has jumped a fence into the road? Bullocks do on occasion
jump fences: we’ve had one or two heifers in our time quite capable of tackling
Beechers Brook if they thought the neighbour’s bull was on the other side. Our
hassled farmer, endeavouring to return the stray to where it belongs, perhaps
with the help of some passing ramblers, realises he is wearing the wrong trousers
and doesn’t have in his pocket the key to the padlock. It may be possible to
unhang the gate, open it away from the padlock, and get the animal back. But
if you’ve ever tried rehanging a gate that is firmly fixed at the other end, you’ll
know it can be more difficult than a Chinese puzzle. Unless the farmer has a
handy length of baler cord about his person, he will have to return home and
276

Sep 7th

Organic System’s Quirks

fetch his key, and the ramblers will go on their way having learnt a thing or
two.
Perhaps I am making too much of this ‘leaving gates open’ business, but it’s
certainly my main, or in our own case, only concern about public access. It so
happens that the day I saw the interview, I found a field gate wide open onto
a little used lane through which there is a public footpath. There are no cattle
in that part of the farm just now, so it was of no consequence, but it is always
a worry. It has occurred in the past and we have had cattle get out onto the
open road as a result.
We have six public footpaths, not in themselves long enough to be that
attractive to walkers, but all of them forming essential links in the footpath
network of the parish. Most of them are short paths across the farm joining one
lane or bye way to another. In recent years they have all been well way-marked
by the Council’s relevant department, which has even very kindly installed new
gates for us where ours were becoming a little tired. In all, we have fifteen
gates on footpaths that need to be kept open or closed depending on which
fields the cattle are in or need access to. And if one walker gets it wrong, every
subsequent walker will repeat the mistake. Not that we see many people using
the paths, in fact fewer than some years ago when there was a big drive to get
all the rights of way opened up.
I suppose we could erect stiles beside each of our fifteen footpath gates, and
then padlock the gates the way we wanted them. How the cattle would react
to the jangle of keys at our belts as we did our daily round of inspection might
be interesting. I hope Miss Ashbrook, who is quoted as intending to press for
further new access, will forgive me for suggesting that she would be wise to
carry the farming fraternity with her.

Organic System’s Quirks
In the words of the harvest hymn - all is safely gathered in. Last week’s mini
heat wave came at just the right moment to harvest our problem crop of spring
barley. You may remember I was worried that, as the crop was so heavily
infested with red shank and smothered by an under-sown red clover ley, Jim
might have a problem harvesting it at all. In the event, the combine driver
skimmed over the top of the assorted vegetation taking little more than the
ears of barley. It was probably all that was possible - attempting to cut any
lower immediately bunged up the works. The result was surprisingly good - over
ninety per cent of the barley recovered and, with the accompanying weed-seed,
277

2005
successfully treated with a double dose of propionic acid. It was a light crop,
but as an organic feed for the cattle, well worth the cost of harvesting.
Jim hadn’t intended bothering with the straw, which in the circumstances
was almost non-existent. However, what there was might well have formed
a mat, killing the clover in nasty streaks across the field, and with the heat
wave continuing for a couple of days after combining, two small loads of straw
from the 15 acres were salvaged before Sunday’s welcome rain. I say salvaged,
because even after two hot days, the weed and clover mixed with it was hardly
dry enough, but at least it is off the field. If it heats up very much, it may end
up being spread about in our empty cattle yards, to dry out and act as a base
for the winter bedding. And for that purpose alone, it will be worth having.
Sufficient straw for bedding is always a problem. To grow enough ourselves
would involve producing more corn than we require for animal feed, and with all
the assurance rules that have to be followed nowadays to sell corn to the merchants, we have preferred to buy in what extra straw we needed. Fortunately,
under the organic rules, we are allowed to continue buying in non-organic straw
for bedding; Jim has already had a small load from Dorset delivered, to replace
the quantity of straw we were obviously not going to get from our barley. It
wasn’t cheap and according to the lorry driver is likely to be in short supply
in future. Had we been obliged to buy organic straw, I hate to think what it
would have cost, or even whether it would have been obtainable.
This does put into question the whole philosophy of organic farming. I
accept that straw for the animals to lie on isn’t going to pose much doubt about
the guarantee of freedom from inorganic chemicals in cattle or sheep meat. I
have queried the possibility of pesticide residues remaining in the resulting
farmyard manure, but I am assured this doesn’t happen, particularly if the dung
is properly composted. But allowing the possibility of non-organic material into
organic animal feed apparently doesn’t stop there.
Under EU Organic Regulations, DEFRA have recently issued a list of nonorganic ingredients that may be included up to a certain percentage in animal
rations, if the organic equivalent isn’t available. In cattle and sheep, a maximum of 5 per cent will be allowed for just two more years, but for pigs and
poultry it amounts to 15 per cent on a reducing scale until 2011. And it’s a
fairly comprehensive list of ingredients. What on earth’s going on? We’ve only
recently gone organic, but this is hardly how I expected organic farming to be.
In fact I could suggest that our meagre 2 cwt. of nitro-chalk fertilizer per acre
and the very rare use of a chemical weed killer on our corn, was probably more
organic than most free-range organic poultry farms, when it comes to residues
in food.

Where There’s Muck

I realise that there is bound to be an imbalance in the supply of feed available for any surge in public demand, especially for organic pork and poultry
products. These rely more on bought-in feed than beef and lamb, but it doesn’t
seem very clever to me to adulterate the product merely to keep the shopper
happy. I’d call that sloppy marketing. Perhaps I’m being a troublemaker, (as
usual), but I would rather organic rules were strictly adhered to, and if that
resulted in shortages, so be it. Farming has always been more profitable when
the market is undersupplied. And if it gave us another reason to keep out less
assured foodstuffs from other countries, so much the better.

September 14th
Where There’s Muck
Having spent most of the day sitting in front of the television set, watching
England batting out the final overs at the Oval to regain the Ashes, it seems
a bit incongruous to end the day in front the computer, writing about dung
spreading. As an inveterate watcher of televised cricket, it’s obvious which was
more important, but apart from the fact that some of Pietersen’s sixes were
bordering on the agricultural, nothing should be further from my mind just
now than farmyard manure.
However, having decided that this was to be my subject for the week, I
shall not allow myself to be distracted. It’s not surprising really, since anyone
coming down our lane recently would only have to open their car window a
crack to be aware of the exact nature of the work that has been going on
here. The pong is now fading, but for a day or two it was fairly obtrusive, and
almost needed our house windows closing when the breeze was from the wrong
quarter. By comparison to the product of other farms in these parts, it was
really pretty innocuous, although I have noticed over the years that farmers can
be quite tolerant of the aroma of their own FYM, while objecting to that of
the neighbours, especially where the source is derived from a different species
of animal to their own. Like many of my colleagues, I can tell instantly with
one sniff whether I am passing a pig, poultry, dairy or beef farm when dung
spreading is in progress. Unfortunately, the non-farming public is not interested
in such niceties - it is just one big turn off.
While some of these countryside odours are certainly more pungent than
they used to be, there is one aspect of the problem that has changed for the
better: we get the job done much faster now. Years ago, it was all dungfork, wheelbarrow and butt-cart work, the boring but inevitable annual slog
only relieved by the thought that where there was muck, there was money.
279

2005
Thankfully by the time I started farming, the mechanical dung spreader had
appeared on the scene, but just filling it still involved an awful lot of hand
labour. The arrival of the tractor front-loader soon dispensed with that backaching process and really got the job speeded up. In recent years, while we
employed a full-time tractor driver, it became a routine three or four week
annual clean up of the cattle yards ready for the coming winter. There was a
general niff around the farm during that time, which became unnoticeable to
us, although tending to cling to one’s clothing when off the farm.
All that has changed once again – I sometimes wonder how many more
changes to farming practices I will witness during my lifetime. Without any
full-time help, we have reverted to using a contractor to deal with the four or
five hundred tons of manure our animals produce each year. The folk living in
our immediate neighbourhood should be well pleased with the new system. No
longer is our dung-spreader trundling up and down the lane day after day; no
longer is that indefinable aroma wafting into their houses, during hot, autumn
weather. We are bang up to date with our farm machinery, or rather our
contractor is. Single-handed, he is capable of completing the entire job in a
couple of full days, although this year it was convenient for him to break off
and do a bit of silage or straw baling on other farms when requested.
For our part, getting the job done quickly when conditions are exactly right
for the land is very important with all the constraints we have to observe nowadays to avoid soil compaction and run off into streams and ditches. Ten-ton
spreader loads in small Devon fields may sound like a contradiction in terms to
describe good agricultural practice, but the only problem we have is the size
of our gateways. The actual spreader is far more efficient in breaking up and
scattering the dung over a very wide area, and the size of the tyres on both
tractor and machine is such that any damage to soil structure is possibly less
now than at any time since I started farming.
We may regret the loss of people working on the land today, but bringing
them back just to spread dung in the ways we used to do, is not my idea of a
better future for the farming industry.

Oxen Shoeing Mystery

September 21st
Oxen Shoeing Mystery
With the wheat stubble sliding gently into the ground, the fertile soil in this
field was being turned up to a mild sunless autumn day, probably for the thousandth time on this ancient Devon farm. The 50 competing ploughmen were
going slowly and carefully about their task, stopping every so often to take a
measurement or make a slight adjustment as they sought to leave their plots
with the inch-perfect, laser-straight furrows necessary to win their class. We
were watching the 60th Annual Ploughing Match of the Cheriton Fitzpaine &
District Ploughing Association, taking place last Sunday at Priorton Barton, a
farm in our neighbouring parish at East Village.
And the ploughing wasn’t everything there was to see. There were classes
from the ‘best short term ley’ to the ‘best acre of sheep keep’, from a ‘bale
of hay from land never ploughed’ to the ‘longest stem of maize’, and with
produce classes as varied as ‘Can’t go Wrong’ chocolate cake, jellied beetroot,
photograph of ‘Men at Work’ and decorated gingerbread ‘person 7 years and
under’. Close to 100 classes in all.
But back to what it’s really all about, the intense competition to be the
best at that most basic farming process, ploughing the land. How the judges
manage to separate the contestants I’ve no idea; to me the individual plots
in each class look virtually identical. It’s not really surprising the standard is
so high - two of the competing ploughmen, Bill Yeandle and Bill Tonkin, are
national champions, and the work is progressing under the watchful eyes of six
farmers, including their President, my long-time friend Bill Bulled, a national
champion in his day, who all took part in that first ploughing match on this
very farm 60 years ago. (It seems that round these parts if you want to get to
the top in the ploughing world, make sure you’re christened William.)
By 5 o’clock, all is done, the judging completed, the plough blessed, and the
cups and prizes handed out. The one slight disappointment for the organisers
was the lack of any entry for the horse ploughing class. I doubt if there are
any farmers in the surrounding parishes that use a horse today. While many
of the tractors were quite old enough to have been working at that inaugural
match, horses would still have been the predominant source of power in the
1940s. However, since the ploughing match was taking place on a farm famous
for the quality of its North Devon cattle, it crossed my mind that it must have
been oxen that ploughed these fields for centuries.
While the breed is recognised as producing the sweetest tasting beef of any
in the world, it is not so widely known that North Devons were once held in
281

2005
high regard as draught animals. Dickson, in his Practical Agriculture’ of 1805,
rates them as having great superiority over many other breeds, saying they are
“admirably calculated for the purpose of labour”.
Apparently until as late as the beginning of the 19th Century, the use of
oxen was widespread in the British countryside, two oxen being considered a
match for one horse, but having the great advantage of being less likely to get
injured, living on far cheaper food, requiring no grooming, and, at about eight
years old, having increased in size and value, being sold for fattening to make
good beef.
It all sounds too good to be true, but how on earth were they shod? Cattle
with bad feet are enough trouble to deal with nowadays, but trying to nail shoes
on a bullock is something else again. The accounts vary from “the expense of
shoeing an oxen is a mere trifle” to descriptions of throwing the beast to the
ground and sitting on its neck while the feet are lashed to a tripod to allow the
farrier to nail the two half-moon shaped “cues”, as they were called, to each foot.
We found one of these cues once, and our farrier, Colin Dayment, agreed it was
an ox-shoe. I asked him recently how one put a nail into a bullock’s foot, which
is far more delicate than that of a horse. He didn’t know, but he remembers
his father telling him that he once shod a bullock for a demonstration at the
Devon County Show, when it was held at South Molton in 1945. There must
be plenty of farmers alive who were there on that occasion. I would be most
interested to hear about it.

September 28th
Looking Back to 1945
There seem to be 60th anniversary farming events occurring all over the place at
the moment. Ten days ago it was our local ploughing association holding their
diamond anniversary match and last week it was the turn of Bow and District
Young Farmers Club to celebrate their 60 years of existence. Jenny and I were
guests at their anniversary dinner and dance, with William Pickard, President
for the past thirty years and a founder member of their committee, and Frank
Davis, their current Chairman, our hosts for the very well attended evening.
How long into the night the dancing continued I’ve no idea, but Frank was due
to be milking cows by five o’clock the next morning, so he probably never got
to bed. I must congratulate their Club Secretary, Emma Quick, on organising
such a huge turn out of members, past and present.
I suppose it’s understandable that so many farming clubs and social groups
should have been founded in 1945. The war was over, but food was still rationed,
282

Sep 28th

Looking Back to 1945

and would continue to be for some years to come. Food production was therefore
high on the political agenda and likely to remain an important part of the
nations economy. Farming was relatively prosperous, as it always is during and
following wartime, and the prospects for the agricultural industry looked good.
Which, together with a number of personal reasons, is why I decided to become
a farmer. All these anniversary events have reminded me that 1945 was also
the year I started my first job as a farm worker, intending to get 18 months
practical experience before going on to university.
I remember my first morning very well, cold and frosty, and beginning with
a lesson on how to start the farm tractor. Having adjusted the fuel supply from
paraffin to petrol, it was important to set the timing correctly and grasp the
crank handle with the right grip. Failure could result in a backfiring engine and
a dislocated thumb. Surprisingly, what I don’t remember is how much I was
paid.
I have a number of “Young Farmers’ Club” booklets among my office junk,
which were published in 1945, as well as an agricultural reference book of that
same year, so it didn’t take me long to find the minimum wage rates in operation
at the time. As a 17 year-old, I was apparently paid the princely sum of one
shilling an hour, or 5p in today’s money. The going rate for an adult was £4 for
a 48-hour week. Having got out these old booklets, I found myself comparing
how much farmers were receiving for the various commodities with the prices
we get today.
For instance, a fat lamb then was worth about £3, a prime bullock about
£35, milk one shilling and eight pence a gallon and wheat about £14 a ton. Land
values varied very considerably, which is understandable when you think about
the difficulty in those days of trying to make a living from poor or infertile
farms, but I reckon £40 an acre would be a fair average. There used to be
a school of thought that advised using the cost of a ‘Mars Bar’ as a means
of testing whether an article had inflated disproportionately in value over the
years. Minimum farm wage rates, since they’ve been fixed by an Agricultural
Wages Board since before 1945 right up to the present day, should serve the same
purpose. If, therefore, you take £4 in 1945 to be equivalent to the minimum
wage of £200 today, you can make a reasonable comparison, even allowing for
the shorter working week
This would mean that farmers in 1945 were getting, in today’s money, about
£150 for a lamb, £1750 for a fat bullock, 90p a litre for milk and £700 a ton
for wheat. Of course, cows now produce double the amount of milk on average
as they did then, and wheat yields are up threefold, but even so it shows how
much the real value of food has dropped over the last 60 years. Interestingly,
283

2005
the value of farmland using the same calculation should now be about £2000 an
acre, which is not very wide of the mark if the present value of the farmhouse
is ignored.
We’ve had farm subsidies since 1947 expressly in order to keep down food
prices, but with these now on the way out, and the very real possibility of global
warming, will farm prices eventually have to get back to these levels if we’re to
avoid going hungry?

October 5th
Am I Really a Churl?
Margaret Beckett is reported as having betrayed Britain’s farmers once again,
following remarks she made at last week’s Labour Party Conference. A storm
seems to have blown up over her suggestion that we should be re-branded “land
managers”, to emphasise to the public that producing food is only an awkward
by-product of keeping the countryside looking pretty. I must admit my first
reaction wasn’t outrage so much as surprise that her remarks were even worth
reporting. After all, her view of farming hasn’t changed since the day she took
office, at the tail end of the Government’s disastrous handling of the foot and
mouth outbreak. I imagine the instructions from her boss, who was smarting
from the bad publicity he had received at the time from a media sympathetic to
the farmers’ plight, were to get us back to our proper place at the bottom of the
pecking order as quickly as possible. Which of course she did, by immediately
taking the word “agriculture” out of the title of her department.
It is often suggested that there’s a diabolical political plot to do away with
individual farmers (I will avoid using the term ‘family farmers’ – it seems to
cause hackles to rise unnecessarily), and leave food production in Britain as some
sort of corporate activity only undertaken on an industrial scale, unsuitable land
being abandoned to the retiring rich or leisure seeking masses. I don’t believe
a word of it. Unless votes are involved, politicians don’t give the matter a
second thought. In this particular case, Mrs Beckett is merely ensuring that if
suddenly there is no beef on supermarket shelves, no blame can possibly attach
to her. She has always made it clear that in future food production is entirely
the industry’s responsibility and if Brazil should find a more lucrative market
for it’s beef, it will be UK farmers who have let the side down. Her job will
not be on the line. Of course, if due to global warming, a sudden 30-foot tidal
wave surges up the Thames and floods most of London, as minister for the
environment she will happily take full responsibility, safe in the knowledge that
it’s unlikely to happen in her lifetime.
284

Lack of Calves Profit

Perhaps I’m being churlish about a suggestion which Mrs Beckett may have
intended quite seriously to help us with our public image, as she launches us
into the rough world of market forces. Maybe “farmer” is an outdated word
to describe us anyway - I confess I’ve never given it much thought. I know
it was originally used by our Norman overlords to describe their tenants. It
derived from the French for rent, and referred to a person who paid for the
right to collect and keep taxes. In that context I suppose it is rather a dirty
word, seeing we’ve gained the reputation over the years as being an industry
dependant on the receipt of public funds in the form of agricultural subsidies.
What are the alternatives? Calling us ‘land managers’ is a dismal idea. It
sounds as if we’re some kind of 4x4 vehicle, rather than the modern equivalent
of the genial, ruddy-faced, straw sucking rustic that used to grow the nations
food, while at the same time looking after the countryside and the abundant
wildlife that filled it. Mind you, we were never that, but embellishment is what
branding is all about. A good brand needs to be cheerful and uplifting, making
you feel the world is a better place for the existence of the product or people
it’s describing.
I skimmed through my dictionary to see if any of the old words for ‘sons
of the soil’ would be suitable, without much luck. ‘Peasant’ used to mean a
small farmer, but is now a person who is coarse, boorish or ignorant and like
“farmer”, came in with the Normans, so that’s out. An even older word, which
was completely new to me, and described a farmer or farm worker in Saxon
times is “churl”, but has come to mean a surly ill-bred person – hence the word
“churlish”. It looks as if any word used to describe our occupation eventually
ends up meaning the complete opposite of the cheerful, outgoing, hardworking
chaps we really are. There was one exception I found to prove the rule –
“husbandman”, an archaic word just meaning a farmer and nothing else. Quite
a nice word if a little long, but I suppose it might be considered too sexist to
use today.

October 26th
Lack of Calves Profit
Getting out of the car the other day, I took a deep breath and was struck by how
sweet and fresh the Devon air tasted. Its no wonder people living in the Home
Counties are buying up properties and moving to the Westcountry. We had just
returned from a holiday staying with relations in Sussex and Kent, where my
family roots are and where I spent my teenage years. We had intended to motor
on after a brief visit and explore the Norfolk broads, but our car started playing
285

2005
up and we settled for what proved to be a very relaxing time with cousins we
see all too rarely.
Why the air quality here was so noticeably different this time I’ve no idea.
Traffic there was horrendous, as always, compared with Devon, but unfortunately our car numbers are rapidly catching up, so that can’t be all of it.
Perhaps the prevailing west wind was blowing as we got home, giving us first
use of the Atlantic air before it gathers up the nations exhaust fumes on its
journey east. Whatever, it was nice to be back.
One of the pleasures for me of going on holiday is the chance to get completely away from day-to-day news. On this occasion we didn’t buy a national
newspaper or watch television. Normally I find that very little has changed
in the world in the short time we are out of it, but not this time. A third,
more dangerous hurricane was threatening America; a massive earthquake had
devastated Pakistan; and here in the UK, we were being told to prepare for the
possibility of another animal disease that could spread to people, and wipe out
large sections of the population. I can take the news of disasters like these at
reasonable intervals, but this is becoming ridiculous – 2005 is rapidly becoming
one of the all-time dreadful years for the world in general (in our case, the dead
parrot of that now legendary joke looks like having the last laugh).
Which seems strange, since on the farm we have so far enjoyed one of the
most benign years I can remember. We’ve had rain when we’ve needed it to
keep everything growing and dry weather at the right times to make harvesting
easy. I may be speaking too soon, with two months still to go, but it doesn’t
exactly feel as if the apocalyptical horses are champing at the bit round here.
The winter corn is up nicely, there is plenty of grass about to keep the cattle
outside for some weeks yet, and the Angus heifers are producing good lively
calves at regular intervals. There is one cloud on the horizon, however, which,
for all the recent high-level discussions, refuses to go away. I am referring to
the price of beef.
Currently, beef prices are 10p a kilogram down on what they were at this
time last year, and 5p a kilogram down on what they were the year before. It
was difficult enough to make much profit in those years even with the help of
a beef subsidy. With beef subsidy payments now removed, if the present price
remains at this level there is no way we can rear these Angus calves without
making a loss on each one that reaches maturity. It sounds a horrible thing to
say, but if we wish to continue producing beef in future, and this is an ideal
farm for extensive suckler beef production, we should be shooting each calf as
it is born before the cow starts to mother it, and by avoiding any unnecessary
expense in rearing it, mark time on the farm until the we see how beef prices
286

Nov 2nd

Special Deals Stink

are at this time next year when the cow calves again. In a hard-nosed business
world, that would be the logical thing to do, short of giving up beef production
altogether. Of course, we won’t do that and nor would any other beef farmer
in similar circumstances; it goes totally against farming principles – but what
a terrible indictment of the present state of affairs in the industry.
I hope I’m not sounding too pessimistic - we really did have a good holiday.
But I would hate the thought of giving up cattle altogether; they are the last
animals I would abandon in a farmed countryside. I suppose I should be grateful
just now that I’m not a chicken farmer.

November 2nd
Special Deals Stink
I have a confession to make. If I had to buy carrots in a supermarket, I can’t
see myself choosing cracked or crooked ones. It’s hardly an offence meriting a
stretch in the Tower of London, but I sometimes feel we’re being pressured by
the great and the good into believing that we’re being unpatriotic. Or, worse
still, disloyal to farmers by giving the supermarket bosses more ammunition to
screw growers further into the ground than they already are.
Well, I’m unrepentant. Why shouldn’t we select the cleanest and straightest
carrots? It can be the best indication they’ve been grown in light stone-free soil,
which they should be. And if we choose potatoes with the least signs of damage
or apples without a blemish, that’s our prerogative. After all, we’re paying.
If people want to criticise shoppers being picky, I suggest they go and watch
French housewives buying their groceries. Talk about pinching the peaches or
sniffing the fish - and the French are loyal enough to their own farmers.
I know appearance isn’t everything when it comes to buying food, but it’s
a heck of a lot these days. It’s why see-through plastic, unopenable and nonrecyclable, is the norm. Unless, of course, the product is branded, in which
case if we don’t like it when we get home, we can easily avoid buying it another
time. But how else do we judge taste? If I’m looking for something to munch as
I pass through our orchard, I know the apple the wasps have started to attack
will be the sweetest. But I wouldn’t buy one like that in a shop - it would
start going off before the day was out. And that is one of the biggest problems
the supermarkets have – wastage. To which there is no easy answer so far as
farmers are concerned - we will inevitably continue to face the most stringent
conditions in any contracts we enter into to help them extend shelf life and
reduce unsold surplus.
287

2005
I’m not altogether sure about all this talk of curbing the power of supermarkets anyway. They have developed the finest method of selling bog-standard
groceries to an indifferent and time-hungry public ever devised. You only have
to stand and watch for half an hour in a large superstore in one of our more
crowded cities to be aware of that. And however much top quality, specialist
regional foodstuffs we produce, there will always be a greater demand for the
Friday evening traffic-clogged rush on the way home from work, to the free car
park, the whistle stop tour up and down the aisles, the inevitable queue at
the checkouts (why is there always only one checkout manned for every three
shoppers waiting to pay?), before driving on to get tea for the kids, wondering
how so much money has been spent on the basic essentials in so little time.
So what are we hoping the Office of Fair Trading will do to ensure that we,
the primary producers, get a fair share of this multi-billion-pound spend? I am
at a loss to know what to suggest. If we demand that we always receive at least
the cost of production, what prevents the multinationals from buying cheaply
even more food from abroad? A tax on air fuel, however desirable, is not within
the OFT’s remit. Parking charges collected by the local council to redress the
advantage enjoyed over local traders isn’t enough either – it’s the fact that the
car park is always within trolley pushing distance that’s the main attraction.
There is one aspect of supermarket trading however that I really do object
to, and it’s something that the OFT just might be able to control. It’s the
excessive use of ‘great deals’, ‘money offs’, and ‘two-for-ones’ that all the stores
employ to persuade us to buy more than we need. I fall for it like everyone
else. I could probably manage on one bottle of red wine a week but I always
succumb to buying any 3 for £10. I can hardly remember when I last bought a
bottle at the proper price, but at least in this case it’s some foreign grower I’m
short-changing. Because at the end of the day it’s the primary producer who
pays, or his produce isn’t going to be on the shelves. I’m pretty sure it’s the
excess profit on milk that funds the discounted petrol that fuels the vehicles
that fill the car parks that Tesco builds.

My Land Looks Better

November 9th
My Land Looks Better
I’ve always thought of myself as one of a long line of farmers who have lived
here, bringing up their families and farming this land as best they could, and
in doing so, shaping the landscape to what it is today. That is if I’ve thought
about it at all, which was not very often when worrying about the overdraft, the
mortgage, the weather and the work. The one thing that my generation never
did have to worry about, but which is giving the present generation so much
concern, was the future. We just had to get out there and produce more food.
In doing so, we are now accused of damaging the landscape, which suddenly for
the first time seems to be more important to the public than growing enough
to feed ourselves.
Strangely, I find myself sharing this concern, although not to the extent of
making farming merely a by-product of managing the environment, which is
where we seem to be heading. I think most farmers feel as I do, which would
not have been the case before the last war. So what has changed? I think
I’m right in saying that before 1935 two thirds of all farmers in England were
tenants. When I first came here, nearly all the land in this district had until
very recently been owned by a number of estates, which were in the last stages
of selling out to their tenants. Ours was one of the last farms to be sold off by
our particular estate, and as such there were no deeds to this farm. We had
to get affidavits from the two elderly spinsters, the last surviving members of
the family who lived in the manor house, to ensure we were the rightful owners.
We were almost certainly the first farmers to have owned as well as farmed this
small area of land, since the time when the fields were hacked out of the oak
woodland surrounding the iron-age fort, the site of which overlooks us on the
neighbouring farm.
And that is true of many of the other farms round here, and possibly of
most of Devon. It is surprising how many farmers in this neighbourhood are
the sons or grandsons of farmers who originally came to the district as tenants.
Where farming families in the past used to move around as better farms became
available to rent, as owner-occupiers they seem to have put down deeper roots.
When I started farming, I would have welcomed the chance to rent a much larger
acreage than this, but farms to rent were becoming very difficult to acquire. Had
I been able to find one, I wonder if my attitude to looking after the landscape
might now be different.
Years ago tenancy agreements tended to be extremely restrictive. Hedges
had to be maintained exactly as they were, orchard trees replaced if any died,
289

2005
home pastures never ploughed, the quantities and timing of manure and lime
spreading strictly controlled, and even crop rotations decided by the landlord.
Things were becoming easier by the time I started, but as a tenant farmer
I’ve no doubt I would have carped at the unnecessary burdens placed on me,
much as farmers today are muttering at some of the conditions that DEFRA is
imposing with the new single farm payment scheme. In a sense we are now in
danger of reverting to the position of tenants when wishing to reshape the way
our farms are laid out.
I reckon I have been very lucky, therefore, to have farmed at a time when
I was able to modify the farm how I wanted, with very little interference from
politicians or landlords. Looking back, I have to admit it was a good thing
Jenny was there to restrain me on occasion, but I take a certain pride in how
much more productive and easier to manage it is now, than it was in 1950. The
same is true of all the farms surrounding us, but what is surprising is how much
better I think the resulting landscape looks today than it did then.
I’m beginning to want this countryside to remain unaltered – it’s a sign of
old age. But Jim has been putting his stamp on the farm in the last twenty
years, mainly in the form of tree planting and managing the woodland, and no
doubt he will eventually prefer the landscape he is producing. I’m reminded
of the old saying – take off your hat to the past, but take off your coat to the
future.

November 16th
Delving Into the Past
Had I been here, on a still November morning 200 years ago, there would have
been very little to indicate that anything was stirring for miles around. No sound
of a passing car, of a tractor working in the fields, or a plane flying overhead,
and with the farm livestock of those days by now tied up quietly in sheds for
the winter, there would have been nothing to disturb the peace. Perhaps I
might have heard the occasional thwack of an axe in a nearby plantation, but
no chainsaw groaning from across the valley. The midday boom of the explosive
charge from the stone quarry in the village, the loudness of which used to be
an indicator of approaching rain, would have been well established by then,
but the clatter of trains on the Barnstaple line five miles away, even better for
forecasting a change in the weather, was still some years in the future.
However, one strange sound that was to fade away through the next 50
years, could well have been a lone bugle call echoing from over the hill, warning travellers of approaching packhorses. Apparently the ‘Jagger’, the man in
290

Nov 16th

Delving Into the Past

charge, carried a bugle to make sure the way was clear on the long stretches
of lane that had nowhere for strings of ten or a dozen fully laden horses to
pass. Some of the lanes round here are extremely ancient, the one through our
farm almost certainly a Celtic Ridgeway - probably in existence long before the
smaller farms.
Many of these old lanes are very narrow, in some places less than nine feet
wide. With banked-hedges on both sides, I have wondered how horses and carts
managed to pass each other - backing a horse and cart any distance would be
impossible. Could it be that before the Enclosures the hedges were not all
there, or is it that these lanes were little used as cart roads? Certainly they
were the old drove roads and packhorse routes, and perhaps used for a time by
the pony-traps of local farmers, before the arrival of tarmac and the motorcar
pushed us all onto the wider roads to get about. Originally all these lanes must
have started out as footpaths, following the sheep and cattle tracks, which kept
to the firmer ground, but I can’t really see them as part of the extensive cart
and carriage road network of the 18th and 19th centuries.
These nostalgic reflections are the result of reading the evidence that was
presented to a Local Public Inquiry into the legal status of a lane that passes
through a neighbouring farm. This took place with due formality last week in
our parish hall. I wasn’t able to attend, but Jenny returned with 15 pages of
Devon County Council’s Proof of Evidence and about 100 pages of Appendix.
I won’t bore you with the details, since it really only concerns those of us who
live locally and might want to use that lane. It hardly bears thinking about
how much it has cost the ratepayer for the Council to delve into ‘who in the
past did what and when’, ‘whether the owners gave them permission tacitly
or intentionally’, and ‘how it is recorded in bygone maps and parish council
minutes’.
There are countless lanes like this all over Devon – green lanes and accommodation roads – which apparently have little legal protection and are not the
County Council’s responsibility to maintain. Most of them appear to have an
historic right of way of some kind over them, either on foot, on horse, or by
vehicle, but only their owners who need them to go about their business have
any interest in keeping them in good order. The original rights of way were
intended to allow the rest of us to get our goods or ourselves from place to
place, but nowadays that particular requirement has virtually lapsed. We wish
to use them purely for pleasure. Our journey’s end is frequently back where we
started - we’ve enjoyed going nowhere and good luck to us, particularly if we’re
not disadvantaged by the responsibility of ownership.
There will be more of these Inquires as the Council continues to review the
291

2005
definitive map of Devon. The one affecting our own lane is due next year.
I would like to think that some of the obvious friction between the various
categories of would be users is resolved before then - it would be a shame if
the occasional lone biker were never again allowed to ride the short route to
Crediton.

November 23rd
DEFRA’s Morale Problems
I never thought I’d say it, but I really do feel sorry for the poor devils that do
the donkeywork at DEFRA. I thought that we’d finished with Ministry form
filling for the Single Farm Payment Scheme and the Entry Level Scheme months
ago and that the files relating to both schemes would remain on the shelf until
next spring at the earliest. But it was not to be – a few days ago a letter arrived
from Exeter to say that we’d applied for a field that was not on their register,
and we hadn’t asked for it to be digitalised so that it could be recorded. It
seems we are one of the 14000 farmers currently being chased up by DEFRA
staff, to be certain that every last acre is accounted for.
Well, I hope the other 13999 farmers receiving similar requests for information have made mistakes that genuinely need correcting, because if not, DEFRA
has wasted a lot of staff time doing nothing useful. Our field had in fact been
recorded when we applied for the Entry Level Scheme, and we’d had this confirmed by letter from Exeter at the time. I explained all this to a charming lady
on the phone, and she asked me to send back a copy of their own letter and a
map to make sure we were talking about the same bit of ground. Apparently
due to the vast amount of digital mapping that needed to be done this year
to get both schemes up and running in the time available, that for the Entry
Level Scheme had to be farmed out to a private firm and therefore cannot be
crosschecked with the Single Farm Payment Scheme. What all this does for
the morale of the staff working at Exeter I wouldn’t know, but I certainly have
always disliked wasting time even if I was being paid for it.
I suppose this digital mapping is necessary in today’s computer age, but out
of interest, I got out our old 1838 map of the farm to see how much things have
changed. For a start, the field areas in those days were recorded in acres, roods
and poles. In case you don’t know, and I had to look it up to find out, 40 poles
is a rood, and four roods is an acre. Of no special relevance, a pole can also be
called a rod or a perch, but according to our map, apparently not in Devon.
This map is the tithe map for that year, and gives the names of the owners
and tenants for every last little piece of ground, as well as the exact area and
292

Nov 30th

Relief at No Milking

use to which it was being put. It goes even further by recording the tithe due
for each individual field. Our lane, a county byway, which was then and still is
part of the farm, was recorded as being two roods and 30 poles, with no tithe
payable. Obviously there was an incentive for the farmer to have as much lane
as possible. Similarly where a piece of ground was recorded as waste, there was
no tithe due. Pasture and arable, on the other hand, incurred tithe in today’s
money of five and ten p per acre respectively.
It seems that attention to detail was as important to the authorities then
as now. The difference seems to be in the direction in which it was applied. In
those days, the more of our land that could be recorded as pasture and arable,
the happier they were to take money off us. Now that we’re at the receiving
end, their worry is that we might be claiming on more land than we’re actually
farming.
Surprisingly, the accuracy of the field measurements has hardly altered at
all. The boundaries of many of our fields have changed over the years, but where
a field has remained as it was then, the area recorded is virtually identical. We
may be measuring our land in pixels on a computer, but all we end up with
are hectares to two decimal places. Our forebears were using rods, poles or
perches, but they managed to record their field sizes in simple language to a
one hundred and sixtieth part of an acre or, in DEFRA speak, in hectares to
about five decimal places - that’s if I’ve done my sums right. What I would like
to know is how they actually set about taking the measurements in practice no satellite images in those days.

November 30th
Relief at No Milking
My first thought nowadays when waking up to a blanket of snow is one of
profound relief that we gave up milking cows 15 years ago. Living at the end
of a two-mile long lane with no hope of a gritting lorry encouraging the milktanker driver to give it a go, the prospect of pumping milk into emergency
containers and waiting for hours at some main road collection point, is not
exactly conducive to springing out of bed. There’s enough work in bad weather
on a livestock farm without that extra chore to look forward to.
Last week’s heavy snow may be a pointer to a colder than average winter, as
the met office is forecasting, but I can’t remember anything like it in November
before. Real winter round here isn’t supposed to start until Boxing Day at the
earliest. Compared to the old churn lorry, which rarely missed more than one
day’s collection from the milk stand at the end of the farm lane, the outsized
293

2005
tanker that one sometimes encounters in the middle of the night, doing its
rounds when traffic is at a minimum, will be hard pressed to get off the main
roads if we have a prolonged snowy spell. With today’s lorries, we’re not geared
to really bad weather in the southwest, as the shambles near Bodmin last week
demonstrated. For the sake of our dairy-farming neighbours, I hope this was
just a freak occurrence.
After all the talk of farmers going out of milk production in droves, it is
surprising how many dairy farmers there still are round here - at least thirteen
within a three-mile radius of us, some of them with substantial herds. Its true
that there were double that number 15 years ago, but I wonder how many fewer
dairy cows there are in total in this area today, and whether any less milk is
being produced.
The snowy weather came at an opportune time for us. All the cattle are
still out, some with calves at foot but none newly born, and with plenty of
hay every morning as routine, the lack of available grazing for a couple of days
didn’t faze them. The fortunate thing was that Jim had made the decision to
sell all our store cattle this year, rather than keeping half of them, normally the
heifers, to finish as we usually do. Since all these stores were born before we
started our two-year organic conversion period, none of them could have been
sold as organic beef, even though they would have been fattened under the more
costly organic rules. It obviously made more sense to let a non-organic farmer
take them through the next twelve months, even though there will be a loss of
income for us this time next year, when we shall have no cattle to sell.
Considering there is no longer any subsidy to come on them, the stores sold
reasonably well; very little different to previous years in fact, which surprises
me, although I see the beef price has at last started rising above last year’s
level. It will need to rise a great deal more, if the finishers are to make any
profit at all without using their single farm payment as a short-term cushion.
Going organic has at least avoided that worry for us for the time being.
Jim sold some of the stores in the open market, but the majority privately,
which we prefer for the lack of hassle to both the cattle and ourselves. I always
feel a twinge of guilt using our local market in this way to be sure of knowing
how much to expect from a private buyer, but I don’t know of any alternative
apart from selling by weight, which we are not equipped to do.
Selling all these animals means that we have fewer on the farm now than at
any time in the last I don’t know how many years. In view of the very wet spell
we had before last week’s snow, which itself is making conditions pretty slushy
as it melts, a temporary shortage of cattle spread over our drier fields couldn’t
have come at a better time, especially as we are aiming to keep the cows out till
294

Dec 7th

Fed up With Margaret

nearly Christmas. Most of them are not due to calve until the New Year, and
if the cattle yards are still relatively clean then, calf scours or pneumonia are
less likely to arise. Now we are organic, avoiding any of those horrors is even
more important than in the past.

December 7th
Fed up With Margaret
I suppose it was inevitable that sooner or later I would have to eat my words. I
have mentioned on several occasions how well the weather this year has suited
us – hot and sunny for our hay and corn harvests but plenty of rain to keep the
grass growing all summer. I even suggested last week that the unexpectedly
early snow had done nothing to dampen our hopes of keeping the cattle out till
Christmas.
What a silly remark to make. The horrendous downpour that followed has
completely put paid to that, with our driest fields running with surface water
and springs appearing where I’ve never seen springs before. The fields are drying
up a bit now, but the ground will never recover enough this late in the season
and I expect Jim will be bringing in the cows with calves at foot this week.
The in-calf cows should be all right for a while longer out on our hill, which has
been kept in reserve against such a contingency. With a stone quarry at the
top of it, the ground there is a kind of natural concrete, so that even Margaret
Beckett’s green police would be hard put to prove we were damaging the soil.
This late bad spell has certainly made me review my rather rosy opinion
of the weather during 2005, but nothing unusual has occurred that would lead
me to think that our climate was changing. If I’d never opened a newspaper or
turned on the TV, it wouldn’t cross my mind that we might be at the start of
a process, and one that would be irreversible, that might eventually turn our
atmosphere into something like that found on Venus. The Boxing Day tsunami
and the recent earthquake in Pakistan can’t be blamed on the weather, and even
the violence of this year’s hurricanes, which could be attributed to a warmer
Atlantic Ocean, doesn’t seem to have alarmed Americans. In fact, I believe
Darfur is currently experiencing the first worthwhile rain in 20 years, but the
desert turning green around starving refugees is hardly sending the right signals
to the rest of us.
And that, as I see it, is the problem. We accept global warming as a fact
of life, with all the probable consequences, but we don’t seem to be taking it
seriously. I’ve no doubt penguins and polar bears are already in at the deep end,
but would their possible extinction be enough to get us off our backsides where
295

2005
it really matters – in cars and aeroplanes? Because unless someone comes up
very soon with a credible alternative to the internal combustion engine, those
two species may be the first to go.
We agonise over wind turbines and biomass generators, but would opposition
to them melt away if the people living near them had their council taxes as
generously subsidised as the companies building them? And do we perhaps, in
our aversion to nuclear power, patronise future generations by presuming they’d
be incapable of resolving the problem of nuclear waste, where we’ve so miserably
failed. My worry is that however much wind, biomass or nuclear power we opt
for here in Britain, these energy sources won’t fuel cars or planes, at least not
yet.
If you are assuming this is leading up to one of my favourite subjects, biofuels - well, not this time. We can certainly produce enough on farm to drive
all our tractors and farm machinery, but never enough to allow people in the
developing nations to drive as many cars as we do. No, my reason for this
uncharacteristic pessimism is rather more personal. Forget polar bears and
penguins for the moment – it wouldn’t take very many years of really abnormal
weather worldwide to bring farming and food production to crisis point.
So I was dismayed at yet more hot air this week from our Environment
Secretary announcing that she has launched a new 3-year campaign to alert
everyone to a “series of new communication resources entitled - Tomorrow’s
climate, today’s challenge”. Her Climate Change Minister, Elliot Morley, is
proposing a new slogan “Together this generation will tackle climate change”
and DEFRA has set up a new website so that we can read all about it. Meanwhile Margaret Beckett is jetting off to Montreal for a United Nations meeting
next week to start discussions on what needs to be done after 2012. Perhaps it
would be better to rehash that wartime slogan with “Are some of our journeys
really necessary”.

December 14th
Which Sean to Believe?
I find it difficult to understand how so-called experts manage to reach quite
different conclusions from the same information. It happens all too often - you
know the sort of thing. Global warming is a fact: therefore our English climate
will become more like Italy or the south of France and we’ll be growing wine and
olive oil. Alternatively, melting arctic ice will cool the northern Atlantic and
deflect the Gulf Stream further south, giving us weather conditions closer to
Norway or Finland - so bring on the reindeer and fir trees. They can’t both be
296

Dec 14th

Which Sean to Believe?

right, but in this case we should have enough time to adapt and grow whatever
turns out to be the reality. But there are times when it does matter and one
such occurred last week.
As I’m sure you know, we are currently switching over to farming organically.
Jim also has to substantially reduce our suckler herd to conform to the new BSE
regulations, and get rid of any cows born before 1996. We have already culled
10 of our older cows so far this year, but there are 30 left to go, some of them
aged over15 years and still going strong. Replacing all these with bought-in
young organic cows would be hugely expensive and retaining virtually all our
own heifer calves for breeding is a considerable act of faith in the future of the
organic beef market. So I went to two meetings during the week hoping to get
some enlightenment.
The speaker at the Tuesday’s Devon NFU Annual Open Meeting was Sean
Rickard, Senior Lecturer in Business Economics at Cranfield School of Management. As heavyweight an expert as you could wish to listen to, albeit an
academic one, whom I understand has the ear of the Prime Minister. He gave
us his usual precise and diagrammatical presentation on how we should organise
ourselves to survive through the next few years. We must face the realities of
a global market; food prices will decline ever lower with no help likely from
our political masters. Even the newly introduced environmental payments will
disappear over the next ten years. Meanwhile, how lucky we are to have our
single farm payments, with which to buy our way into the processing and retailing side of the food industry, where there’s still money to be made. It made
me think of a stranded climber hanging desperately onto a cliff face with the
fingernails of both hands being advised to reach into his back pocket to pay for
someone to fetch a rope.
I shall pass over his comments on how much better large farms are for the
environment, and what a huge future there is in the use of genetic modification,
where we are falling behind the rest of the world and which we farmers have
failed dismally to demonstrate to an ignorant public. It was his view on the
future of organic production that I’d come to hear about. I’ve heard it before,
but I wondered if it had changed. No way – not one iota. Yes, sales of organic
food had increased by 60 percent, but from such a small base that they’d only
reached three percent of all food sales, where at best they would remain as a
niche product. Even the figures for cat food sales were better. He was pretty
outspoken about organisations like the Soil Association, which he believed had
conned people into thinking that organic farming was the only way forward.
A pretty dismal prediction to take to my next meeting, the Red Meat Industry conference last Friday at Cullompton. I will pass straight to the one speaker
297

2005
likely to have the expert knowledge I was looking for - Sean McCurley, Tesco’s
Category Director for meat, fish and poultry. I doubt if there’s anyone closer
to the action, and to my amazement, he was positively bullish about the future
for organic beef sales. Using the same figure of a 60 percent increase in organic
sales recently, he forecast that by 2010 organic beef would be 10 percent of all
Tesco’s beef sales. They were already drawing up a blueprint for contracts with
processors, underpinned by a Tesco guarantee, to supply their ‘Finest’ range
with 100 percent British, suckler, grass fed, 28-day matured, organic beef.
Did I hear him correctly, and if so, which Sean am I to believe - because it
makes one hell of a difference to us?

January 4th
History of a Fireplace
It’s that time of year again – the shortest day and longest night and Christmas.
Inevitably as I get older, it’s a time for nostalgia, for looking back over all
the Christmases I’ve enjoyed here with the family. And also wondering what
Christmas was like for the families who lived and farmed here before us. In
some ways, it’s the tale of a fireplace through the centuries.
Jim and Bev are having us all to Christmas dinner this year, about fifteen of
us round a large dining table in the main room of the farmhouse. The massive
old open fireplace, with bread-oven alongside, the focus of the room, now has
a wood-burning stove installed, so that whatever the wind direction, we can be
certain of a smoke free atmosphere, which was rarely the case in the past. The
meal will be cooked on an Aga in what was the adjacent parlour before we came
in 1950, and which Jenny and I converted into a farmhouse kitchen.
But before then, ever since the house was built 600 or more years ago,
Christmas dinners were cooked as well as eaten in that ancient main living
room. We knew there had been a range fitted into the fireplace between the
wars, but an old farmer, who had lived here as a boy in 1900, once described to
us how he remembered his mother cooking on the open fire, and using the bread
oven in the old-fashioned way. It made it easy for me to visualise the festive
occasions back through the years, changing little since the stone chimney was
originally built onto the side of the farmhouse in the 16th century.
I say ‘built onto’ with certainty, since the house is obviously much older than
the chimney. When we removed the thatched roof 50 years ago, and replaced
it with slates, the builders pointed out the blackened timbers and soot covered
original thatch base of unthreshed rye straw. They had seen other similar old
farmhouses, and explained that ours must have started life as a small medieval
299

2006
‘hall house’, with an open fire in the middle of the one room, and with no upper
floor. Part of a cruck, which originally supported the roof, is still embedded in
the cob wall opposite the chimney.
So what would it have been like for the people living here in about the year
1500? Although the size of our hall-room seems large (about 18ft by 28ft) for
what must have been a small farm of 50 or 60 acres at most, it is difficult to
believe there was enough space for a whole family, plus farm helpers, to eat and
sleep, with a central hearth burning continually and large enough to do all the
cooking on. If it’s true that the plough-oxen and milk cows were also brought
inside, it must have been a very dirty, smelly smoke-filled place in which to
spend the long Yuletide nights. And sooty rainwater dripping from the smoke
vents in the ridge thatch must have added horribly to the discomfort.
How did they celebrate the coming of the New Year? Out of interest, I
browsed the Internet to find out what foodstuffs would not have been available
compared with 100 years later when a proper chimney with bread oven and
upstairs rooms would have made life so much pleasanter. Turkeys first arrived
from America in 1520, with potatoes reaching us 50 years later. Surprisingly,
and I can hardly believe it, carrots, turnips and parsnips were not being grown
in Britain at the time, and spices, like pepper and nutmeg imported from the
East, were worth more than their weight in gold. This last was particularly
unfortunate, since all non-breeding livestock were apparently slaughtered in the
autumn, due to lack of winter fodder, and the meat so heavily salted to keep
through the winter that spices were all that made it worth eating. And of course
there was no tea, coffee, or chocolate and no sugar, apart from honey.
That left goose and pork (surely they must have kept one or two autumn
born piglets, fattening on scraps for the festive season), poultry, the odd moorhen
or pigeon, together with dried peas and beans, wintergreens and onions. They
also had real plum pudding, apples, pears, nuts, weak beer and, perhaps cider.
How they cooked all this on what was little more than a campfire I’ve no idea,
but where those families must really have enjoyed Christmas more than us, was
in looking forward to lengthening days and the coming of spring, which meant
so much more to them.

Making Poverty History?

January 11th
Making Poverty History?
Watching the huge firework displays, with which the rich nations celebrated the
dawn of the New Year, I couldn’t help reflecting on how it must have appeared
to people in the third world. It was, after all, only six months ago that we saw
a quarter of a million people parading in Edinburgh to demand that the G8
Summit “make poverty history”. Here was the same city letting off eight tons
of fireworks to celebrate a date that may be important to the Scots, but is really
only an acknowledgement that the shortest day of their year is past. What the
total cost around the world’s capitals amounted to - we spent a million pounds
in London alone – I can only imagine. A starving African living on the equator,
where one day is as long as another, would be justified in thinking that people
with full stomachs have very short memories.
I realise that money spent on fireworks and money required to set up institutions to make the world a fairer place don’t exactly relate, but why nations
need to compete with each other in an orgy of pyrotechnics is difficult to understand in the circumstances. If London’s Lord Mayor had set his rockets off
under the Houses of Parliament, instead of merely obscuring that well-known
façade for 20 minutes, I might have felt it money well spent, but perhaps I’m
just being an old fuddy-duddy.
Another puzzling situation that seems to involve a contradiction appeared
in last Saturday’s Western Morning News. On one page it was reported that
Sainsbury’s have announced plans to boost sales of Fairtrade products by 50%
during 2006, by converting 75% of its rose bouquets to Fairtrade, which would
help improve conditions for Kenyan flower growers. The following page had a
harrowing Food and Agriculture Organisation’s account of the severe drought
conditions gathering strength in eastern Africa, which has already caused at
least 30 famine-related deaths in Kenya.
Again, I know you can’t directly relate the two circumstances. Obviously
starving Kenyans cannot subsist on rose bouquets, but one would assume that
if it’s possible to grow flowers, it should be possible to produce more food. It
may well be that by selling roses to us here in Britain, Kenya’s economy will
improve over time to help it feed it’s own people.
Why we need to import rose bouquets at this time of year I’ve no idea –
they’ve no scent that I can detect and what is a rose without a nose? But that
doesn’t belittle Sainsbury’s efforts to do something positive about conditions
for farmers in third world countries. Hopefully they will expand sales of other
Fairtrade food products, which at present have very little impact on what can
301

2006
be grown here in the Westcountry. We ourselves always buy only Fairtrade
coffee, tea, and bananas and some chocolate. What surprises me is that there’s
virtually no difference in price between these and the non-Fairtrade products
of similar quality on the shelves. Are the Supermarkets being big-hearted and
taking a cut in their profit margins (wonders will never cease) or they making
so much out of the ‘run of the mill’ coffee and tea etc, that they don’t notice
it?
Because there is an additional cost involved in the Fairtrade market. The
Fairtrade Foundation was established over ten years ago with the idea of helping small individual farmers, working through self-controlled co-operatives, to
obtain worthwhile long-term contracts for their produce. And, perhaps more
importantly, it also aims to improve the conditions of organised workers, by
overseeing wages, housing and union rights, ensuring no child or forced labour,
and setting environmental standards for Fairtrade products.
For all the political talk of freeing up world trade, which involves messing
about with agricultural support systems that were originally designed to grow
food close to where it is consumed, this concept of Fairtrade seems a far better
route to take. As a farmer, I would feel far easier in the knowledge that all
imported foodstuffs were properly monitored in this way. So far as I can find
out, there are as yet no Fairtrade meat or meat products available. Which is
unfortunate, in view of the appalling revelations that have just surfaced about
beef production in Brazil, where slave labour is being used to clear rainforests to
allow intensive cattle farming. Fairtrade beef on Supermarket shelves would at
least allow consumers to show their disapproval through their weekly shopping.
And as a beef producer, I would be interested in the difference in price.

Robin and Zac’s Ideas
“An instant solution to farming woes” – that was caption of the lead article in
last Wednesday’s WMN, a piece by Robin Page, that arch critic of the rural
Establishment, well remembered from his “One man and his dog” days and now
a Daily Telegraph columnist. Expecting the usual tongue-in-cheek read I found
myself spluttering into my coffee before I was halfway through. What alarmed
me was not that Robin was claiming to have hatched a manifesto to transform
the countryside and British farming in less than 20 minutes on the back of an
envelope. It was the identity of his co-author, Zac Goldsmith, who has recently
been appointed co-chairman of the Conservative Party’s environment policy
group.
302

Jan 18th

Robin and Zac’s Ideas

Now, I know nothing of Mr Goldsmith’s experience of farming, or his qualifications for directing our industry if the Conservatives were to win the next
General Election. Perhaps I had better find out, especially if his thinking is
going to be coloured by some of Robin’s more way-out environmental views. I
read the article therefore in a much more critical frame of mind.
Of the eight manifesto proposals, some are pie-in-the-sky or unenforceable,
and one, the requirement that all imported food should be produced to the same
welfare standards as in Britain goes without saying. But to suggest that to
achieve this, every imported carcass of meat, from Thai chicken to Argentinean
beef, should have a passport, is plain daft when you consider the lengths to
which we have had to go to ensure our own cattle passport system is foolproof.
Breaking the arm-lock of the supermarkets by imposing new taxes on food
based on air and road miles to create fairer competition with the high street,
might actually benefit supermarkets with access to greater volumes of produce.
In any case, taxing food is likely to be reflected in further downward pressure
on prices to primary producers, a process at which supermarkets excel. As
for taxing aviation fuel, roll on, but please not on a national basis or just for
freight - that is if you want to avoid diverting all air traffic to somewhere like
Amsterdam. And it shouldn’t be forgotten that fuel for transport isn’t the
only energy requirement for producing food. A favourable climate can be more
economic in the use of fossil fuel, even with transport taken into account.
However two of the manifesto proposals, the reintroduction of deficiency
payments and the reinstatement of the Milk Marketing Board, are more worrying, because they show a very poor understanding of the past, which Zac
Goldsmith cannot have experienced and which Robin should know better than
to advocate.
I can well remember a packed NFU meeting in Exeter in 1969, at a time
of very poor milk prices, which was being addressed by the then Minister of
Agriculture, Cledwyn Hughes. Before the meeting even started, a funereal
procession led by Wallace Day in a pony-drawn milk float, with a throng of
farmers carrying a coffin on which were the words “British Agriculture RIP”,
paraded down Queen Street followed by a somewhat unruly flock of sheep. Poor
Cledwyn, a nice man but not up to the occasion. He made a pathetic speech,
floundered hopelessly during question time and had to be smuggled out of the
backdoor of the hotel by the police, who were worried for his safety.
There followed 10 years of farming militancy caused mainly by the stranglehold that the deficiency payment system had imposed on the smaller and
financially more vulnerable farmers. The problem with the system was agreeing a fair price for the various commodities at the annual review. What was
303

2006
fair for the larger and more affluent farmers, who tended to be on the committees that agreed these prices, was often far from acceptable for those of us with
mortgages and overdrafts.
As for Robin’s suggestion that there should be a built-in upper limit to prevent the creation of “subsidy millionaires”, deficiency payments subsidised food
not farmers. The system had no mechanism to regulate how much individual
farmers received, and only encouraged better-placed farmers to expand production to the detriment of the environment. Nor was there much incentive to
improve marketing – any success merely resulted in a reduction in Government
support. And the Milk Marketing Board was the classic example of exactly
that. The fact that we clung onto it until 1994, together with the appalling way
it was wound up, are in my opinion the main reasons why dairy farming is in
the mess it is today.

January 25th
Lambs Lift My Spirits
Even on the dreariest January day, the bleating of newborn lambs is as good
as a burst of sunshine or the sight of an early primrose. Actually there have
been primroses in our woodland this year since before Christmas, so they are
losing their place as a harbinger of spring, but the arrival of the first lambs on
the farm never fails to lift my spirits. Not that I expect Bev to welcome the
start of lambing in quite that frame of mind; for her, it’s two or three weeks of
short nights and constant attention to the ewes. Things were rather slow for
the first week, but I see the lambing pens are beginning to fill up now, and the
little flock of ewes and lambs going out by day is swelling. Another week and
some will be outside for good, with the lambs playing tag along the fence in
view from my office window.
We are also calving at the moment, but no such restraint from the cows.
Most of the heifers and younger cows calved last autumn, but the main herd of
about thirty older cows were due to calve from mid-January onwards, hopefully
at a steady rate through to March. What the bull was thinking about nine
months ago, I’ve no idea, but we’ve had a run of 14 calves born in the last fortnight. We have individual calving boxes for about four cows and calves, which
are normally sufficient to allow calves to bond with mother for a few days before
joining their siblings, but this has temporarily stretched the accommodation.
For the first time that I can remember since our dairy farming days, all
the cattle are currently in the buildings. The new regulations about damaging
our grass swards and the possibility of an inspection by officials, who might
304

Jan 25th

Lambs Lift My Spirits

not know the difference between a few hoof prints and irreparable poaching,
has made us a bit wary. This has meant that although the cattle have plenty
of space, Jim has had to use field gates to make temporary pens in the cattle
yards, and hump buckets of water and feed about, since these pens don’t have
access to water troughs and feed barriers.
With luck that little burst of unusual activity is now behind us, the gates
having been dismantled this morning, and providing the remaining cows behave
in a more restrained manner, the rest of the winter should proceed as normal.
They’re a nice bunch of calves, which is the main thing, and brings the total
number of cattle born since we went organic last summer to nearly forty. Let’s
hope all the talk of future demand is still there in two years time, when they’re
ready to be sold as organic beef.
Meanwhile, Jim has been preparing to host a farm walk this week, arranged
by the Silvanus Trust entitled “Adding value to on-farm timber”. With woodland comprising nearly a third of our total farm area, the development of this
side of the farm business has been a very important part of his thinking over
the last ten years. Without it the farm certainly wouldn’t be profitable just
now. When we started farming here, we saw the woods as merely an amenity,
a pleasant place to walk in, but of no significant financial value. There was
one occasion, when we were really up against it, that our then bank manager
advised us to consider felling and cashing in on the two or three hundred mature
oak trees that were scattered through the woods, but I’m glad we resisted his
suggestion.
Jim is probably as competent as anyone I know to show what can be done
to make timber production an integral part of the average Devon farm, just as
it normally is all over Europe, and always used to be here in Britain. It’s not
really diversification, but rather a better way to manage the entire farm. With
some half-decent weather, he should have a very successful event.
As always on these occasions, tidying up the farmyard and workshops has
been the order of the day for the past week. It’s easy not to notice one’s
surroundings until one visualises them through others’ eyes. With that probable
threat of an official farm inspection sometime this coming year, a general clean
up now may well pay dividends, seeing we are no longer allowed to have a messy
and environmentally friendly farmyard. No more farm bonfires, scrap heaps or
rusting machinery for the wildlife to flourish around.

February 1st
Beckett in My Sights
It’s February and we’re into the second month of the second year of the new
Single Payment Scheme. You would expect, therefore, that by now all would
be plain sailing. Nothing could be further from the truth. In our own case,
the problems that our application forms threw up have at last been sorted out.
Our digital mapping, which has been such a headache to most farmers, is now
complete, although I see that there is an obvious misprint on the final set which
has robbed us of half an acre of ground. We’ve decided not to bother to get it
corrected, since it will only add to the thousands of similar errors that DEFRA,
even at this late stage, are struggling do deal with. Until that is done, I don’t
see how DEFRA can begin to work out the actual payment each farm is entitled
to, since to arrive at a final figure, the total national acreage has to be divided
into the total amount of money allocated to the scheme.
I mention this because I was asked very recently for my advice about how a
person should challenge DEFRA’s assessment of the size of a field. The bloke in
question had a five-acre meadow, which had been digital mapped as being less
than two. I asked if this was the only mistake on his farm, but was told it was
the only field the man owned. I am afraid that at that point my sympathy for
the individual evaporated completely. I suggested he had probably overlooked
the fact that DEFRA worked in hectares, where he saw his meadow in acres,
which would account for the discrepancy. But even if that were not the case, I
had no interest in advising him at all. If people like him are getting DEFRA
bogged down over the minutia of this mapping exercise, in order that nonfarmers can claim two or three hundred pounds a year on what are really only
large extensions to their gardens, then the scheme is degenerating into a farce.
Not that I blame them – if money is on offer, however small the amount, people
are entitled to apply.
What really concerns me is how this all going to appear to the taxpayer who
ultimately foots the bill. There are already headlines in the papers saying that
farmers are facing ruin over late subsidy. This may be true, but is hardly the
way to get a new scheme up and running - a scheme that is specifically designed
to get rid of farm subsidies throughout Europe. The intention, a very laudable
one, is to replace production subsidies with financial support for farmers to
manage their farmland in a way that benefits society, while keeping it in a
farmable condition against future needs. At the moment, all the blame for the
chaotic situation that has arisen is being directed at DEFRA staff, which is
completely unfair.
306

Feb 8th

Are Badgers Sacred Cows?

Talk about mission impossible, we all knew when we finally completed our
application forms last May, that the bureaucracy didn’t exist and the computer
programming wasn’t up and running that could process this information satisfactorily by Christmas. We said so at the time. The calculation of an interim
payment could have been arrived at for December, which would have taken all
the heat out of the situation and allowed DEFRA until June to make the final
payments – a timetable that exactly mirrored the payment dates we have been
working under for years.
So whom do I blame? It certainly isn’t DEFRA Minister Lord Bach, who
wasn’t even around when this crazy way of implementing the new scheme was
thought up. He is merely acting as the fall guy. There is only one person
responsible for the fact that, so far as I know, throughout the EU it is only
in England that farmers have so far not received a penny for managing their
farms for the past 13 months under the new rules; that it is only in England
that people who own land with no intention of ever farming it are entitled
to payments for doing nothing at all. Yes, you’ve guessed it - it’s my ‘bete
noire’, Margaret Beckett. She doesn’t seem prepared to stand up and shoulder
the blame. She is the main speaker at the NFU Annual Conference later this
month in Birmingham and, in my opinion, the NFU delegates could do no better
than to boo her off the platform before she has opened her mouth. Perhaps
Tony Blair might take note.

February 8th
Are Badgers Sacred Cows?
With lambing completed and last month’s calving frenzy over for a while, the
daily chore of feeding and bedding down the cattle has settled into the normal
winter routine. Not for long, though – next week will be disrupted by our 6month TB test. At least on this occasion we won’t have to bring in the cattle
from distant fields twice in the week, but they’ll have to be shunted around
the various cattle yards to put them through the crush, which is an unsettling
procedure in itself. This will be our fourth test since our TB breakdown last
April, the first since we started farming here nearly 60 years ago. Let’s hope
we have what will be our second clear test, and we can get back to the normal
routine testing of a TB free herd.
We are still no nearer knowing why we had a TB breakdown in the first
place, or what we can do to prevent it occurring again. We don’t even know if
we ever had TB, since the cattle that were slaughtered showed no post mortem
evidence of the disease. We are a closed herd, only occasionally buying a stock
307

2006
bull, and then only from a reputable breeder. We are, and always have been
doubled fenced, to avoid contact with cattle on neighbouring farms. With the
TB situation in Devon bordering on chaos, has anything happened in the last
year to get things under control? Very little it seems. There has been a lot of
talk from DEFRA and in the media, but the only action that might affect us
has been to dramatically reduce the compensation for the loss of an animal.
According to the fixed compensation tables that came into force last week,
because ours is not a pedigree herd we are now only entitled to a third of
the value of a pedigree animal. Although we began farming with pedigree
cattle, we gave up registering our stock many years ago, since we were not in
the business of selling animals for breeding. However, under the new rules,
individual circumstances no longer matter and no account is to be taken of
the fact that we have records going back many generations from which to select
replacement cows. The extra cost of replacing an organic animal is also ignored.
What is most dispiriting about this sorry state of affairs are the inaccurate
statements, which are repeated ad nauseam in newspaper articles and letters
to the editor. Currently the most annoying misconception is that TB was
brought under control in the ’50s and ’60s without having to slaughter badgers,
and therefore it can be done again. Jen Peace, who farms not far from us,
reminded me recently that this is quite untrue. Before she was married, she
was employed as a secretary in an agricultural organisation that was involved
in helping eradicate TB at the time. Jen clearly remembers that there were
farms in Devon and the Berkley Vale, where, try as they might, the disease
could not be cleared until the Min. of Ag., as DEFRA was then called, had
taken out all the badgers on those farms as well.
Obviously the problem for DEFRA now is the existence of a law protecting
badgers and their setts from any interference whatever. The fact that the law
was only introduced in order to help the police get rid of badger baiting, a
barbarous sport if ever there was one, is apparently of no consequence. We’ve
now got cows and “sacred cows”, and the longer we put off choosing between
them, the more of both we shall eventually have to slaughter.
And it doesn’t end there. At present, species are normally given that sort of
protection when numbers are threatened, and quite right too. Nobody wants to
see dormice, water voles, or otters disappear. But I am alarmed at the increasing
enthusiasm for all sorts of unlikely animals to be given the complete freedom
of the countryside. Wild boar is the latest accidental introduction, which some
suggest we should welcome, since it was originally a native mammal. Maybe,
but it was virtually extinct by the end of Henry III’s reign, and our countryside
has changed a bit since then. In recent years we’ve had to deal with coypu
308

Feb 15th

Great Days of NFU

and mink, and now the grey squirrel is in the firing line. If left alone, I’ve no
doubt wild boar will eventually find itself outlawed, but perhaps not before it’s
had a considerable effect on badger numbers. I don’t see boar and brock living
happily together in our woods.

February 15th
Great Days of NFU
There was a time when the highest in the land were happy to be associated
with the National Farmers Union. In his speech at the NFU’s Annual Dinner
on February 17th 1953, the then Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, said “I wish
to thank you, Mr President, for the broad-minded confident and virile spirit in
which you have presented the vast and vital problem of British agriculture”.
He was referring to James Turner, the NFU leader of those days, and known to
all and sundry as “Sunny Jim”.
Churchill went on, in typical Churchillian rhetoric, exhorting farmers to
redouble their efforts to increase food production, saying “ The balance between
population and food supply has tilted to an uneconomic, unwholesome and
dangerous extreme. A vast growing world towers up around us and reveals
increasing strain and tension. Populations almost everywhere outpace the food
supply”. We had by 1953 reached almost 60% self-sufficiency, but we were told
“the job must be finished, and finished soon, and when finished it is by no
means the end, only the opening of a further task”.
As a young impressionable new entrant to farming at the time, you can see
why I felt obliged to belong to an organisation that obviously had so much clout
with government. Of course, so soon after wartime food shortages, it is hardly
surprising that farmers were the nation’s blue-eyed boys. But as we succeeded
in the task we had been set, so the influence of the NFU seemed steadily to
wane.
I see that this year’s after dinner speaker at the NFU’s Conference Dinner
is Henry Bloefeld, the BBC’s cricket commentator. After last summer’s ‘Ashes’
triumph, I’m sure ‘Blowers’ speech will be an uproarious success, but what it
will have to do with farming is anybody’s guess. In saying that, I’m being
somewhat unfair to the NFU.
50 years ago the NFU dinner was the main platform on which the political
big guns could be rolled out. Nowadays, there are two days of NFU conference
to sit through, where Ministers from Westminster and Brussels can read their
set speeches and answer carefully orchestrated questions. What purpose it all
serves I fail to see. All that really matters should be the actual AGM. In nine
309

2006
years out of ten, it might be as poorly attended as the AGMs of any organisation
generally are. But once in a while, in troubled times, a really big turnout of
dissatisfied members is surely the best way to shake up an uninspired leadership.
An outside challenge for the top job, as we are seeing this year, however well
intentioned, can sometimes backfire, and cement those in authority more firmly
in place.
Unfortunately, the AGM has once again been put back to the early time of
9am, the first item of the Conference Agenda’s second day, making it difficult
for those of us with further to travel to attend. Perhaps that is the intention I certainly won’t be making the effort. But there is one area of the NFU’s work
that I find dismally inadequate, and which I would raise if I were there. We
don’t seem to have anyone with the stature and personality to really sell British
farming to the wider public. With public image so important in influencing
today’s politicians, we are sadly lacking. I know ‘Sunny’ Jims and Henry Plumbs
don’t show up very often, but there must be others out there we could employ
to our advantage. We are very lucky to have a well-known and widely respected
Anthony Gibson doing the job for us here in the South West, but we should be
headhunting a national Anthony without delay.
There is one more quote from that Churchill speech that I can’t resist including – “Some people are very fond of forms and coupons, but you would
have a bleak and thin meagre diet if you tried to keep yourself alive only by
them. . . . . . away with them! They should be cut down as far as they possibly
can, and as soon as they possibly can”. Coupons and rationing were soon dealt
with after that, but alas, subsequent Prime Ministers down the years have failed
dismally on the form filling pledge. It seems to have resulted in many farmers
having to keep themselves on a very meagre diet indeed.

February 22nd
Annual Whinge Time
I’m doing my best to be upbeat this week, but it’s not as easy as it should be.
For a start, we were very relieved last week to get through our six-month TB
test without any reactors. This was our second clear test since our TB troubles
began last summer, and means we are back to routine annual testing. It would
be nice to assume that we can now go for another 50 years, as we had before
last year, without any worry. Unfortunately there are too many farms here in
the southwest where TB reactors keep recurring after a few clear tests, for any
great optimism. It’s high time that DEFRA officials stopped all the talking,
bit the bullet, and tackled the job of eradicating this horrible disease in exactly
310

Feb 22nd

Annual Whinge Time

the same way as we successfully did those many years ago. The documentary
evidence is all there for them to see.
That said, there should be plenty of other reasons to be cheerful just now.
The wind may be howling in from the east, but at least it’s not raining as I
write. If the weather stays like this, we can expect March to come in like a
lion, which is the best way to start the growing season. But not this year,
according to every newscast we are currently bombarded with. These are the
ideal conditions for the westward spread of bird ‘flu.
And what are DEFRA doing about it? The same as usual – waiting hopefully for the best. Surely everything we’ve been through with BSE, TB and
Foot and Mouth Disease in recent years proves that action is always better
than reaction. Get the nation’s poultry flocks inside immediately and start
vaccinating, while infection is still only in wild birds. That way we can avoid
the costly nightmare of once again needlessly slaughtering countless animals,
with the attendant despair of the people whose lives and livelihoods are bound
up with them. I shouldn’t pontificate - I’m not a poultry farmer, and I realize
that housing free-range birds will be extremely difficult, but if vaccination ‘to
live’ is an option, I would grab it. We never had the chance with FMD, only
the possibility of vaccination to halt the spread of infection, with the subsequent slaughter of vaccinated animals, when time allowed – something people
conveniently forget.
So what else have we been looking forward to? We are expecting a muchneeded first instalment of our organic entry-level scheme payment, which was
due on February 1st. We have been following all the environmental changes to
the way we farm that we were required to do since last August, but apart from
an acknowledgement of our application, we had heard nothing. Assuming all
was in order, a couple of days ago I phoned DEFRA to question the delay. We
have now received a letter with some queries about our application form that
need answering. Why has it apparently taken six months before our application
is even looked at? I hesitate to lay all or even any of the blame on DEFRA staff
- I know what pressure they’ve been working under. And I can’t really believe
there’s a government plot to hang onto money due to farmers for as long as
possible – or can I? Perhaps I’m tempting fate if I say I’m expecting a belated
query about that other bleak form-filling episode we all endured last May, the
single farm payment scheme. I see we’ve been promised last year’s payment
within a month, which is ominous.
In case you’re thinking I’m being totally miserable – forget it, I’m just
having a damn good February whinge. It’s a good time of year to look back
to the old days, when life on the farm was so much better. I recently came
311

2006
across an account of the 1865-67 cattle plague in an old journal of the Ministry
of Agriculture. Apparently ‘murrain’ had been around for thousands of years,
producing worldwide pandemics at intervals, wiping out millions of cattle and
causing mass starvation. It was imported into Britain in 1714, when a Thomas
Bates, surgeon to George I, got the disease under control by a slaughter policy.
It arrived again in 1749, when no one in government thought to check the
records to see what measures had worked before. Half a million cattle died.
Things don’t change much, but at least today you don’t get hung, drawn and
quartered, which was apparently the penalty in the Middle Ages for failing to
follow the rules for dealing with the disease.

March 1st
Hoping for a Time of No News
What a pleasure it would be to have a few months with no farming news whatever hitting the headlines. Nowadays, good news hardly merits a mention, but
we are continually weighed down with the latest disaster the media can find to
get its teeth into. If it isn’t some animal pandemic threatening human health,
a bird in reduced circumstances due to modern farming, or a popular but overprotected mammal facing a possible cull, there is always the latest example of
DEFRA’s bureaucratic shortcomings to fall back on. I can’t remember being
bothered by reports like these as a young man. Maybe I was just too busy
trying to keep on top of the farm work to read the papers or listen to the radio
- TV didn’t reach us until we got mains electricity. About the worst that could
happen to upset the public in those days was some farmer pushing out too many
hedges – and being paid a subsidy to do it.
These thoughts arise from browsing through a bundle of old newspapers,
which a friend loaned me recently. He had been removing some lino from a
floor in his parents house and discovered it was lined with complete copies
of the Devon and Exeter Daily Gazette, plus the occasional Western Morning
News, Daily Mail and Daily Mirror. They cover a period from 1917 to1927,
and although somewhat yellow with age are still very readable. Presumably
at the time they would have been the only way, apart from hearsay, of finding
out what was going on in the outside world. As you would expect, the editions
covering the two final years of the Great War are full of real news, although
heavily slanted to the point of propaganda. The editors of those days were either
under orders to gloss over British setbacks and casualty numbers, or allowed
patriotism to get in the way of a sensational scoop.
312

Mar 1st

Hoping for a Time of No News

But once the war is over, the news, certainly at regional level, becomes
increasingly boring as the years go by. Perhaps those copies that reported
earth-shaking events never went under the lino. A woman fainting in the dock
on being sentenced to death for murder or Jack Hobbs making 130 for England
against Australia are examples of lead stories. The WMN even had a regular
‘Court Circular’ and a front page of closely packed columns of advertisements
– easily mistaken for an old edition of ‘The Times’.
However there are plenty of farming items to give an idea of what would
have interested the average reader. There are frequent reports of farm auctions
and local NFU meetings, fluctuations in the price of wool and prospects for the
hay harvest, with the occasional more lurid tale of a farmer at market fined
for exposing a ewe with sheep scab in a public place or a horse gored to death
overnight by a bull in a field. One strange item is about a debate in parliament
attempting to get the tax on Devon milk when sold in Somerset or Dorset
rescinded. That was a new one on me, and seems very harsh for a dairy farmer
with a milk round that straddled the county border.
Road accidents hardly figure at all, and the traffic congestion that occurs
nowadays near every big city would have rated banner headlines. Jenny and I
were travelling into Manchester last weekend to visit our daughter and family.
The last few miles were a slow procession along eight lanes of motorway ringroad
clogged with commuting Mancunians, one to a car. To newsreaders of eighty
years ago it would have been unbelievable. We were like human lemmings,
spewing out carbon dioxide regardless, heading for the edge of extinction. I
shrugged off what guilt I might have felt, since we’d travelled up from Exeter
for once in a bus full of people.
I would dearly like a glimpse at a bundle of newspapers from eighty years
in the future to see how the story unfolds. Today’s farming problems will be
hardly worth a mention if global warming, that other persistent headline, is
really happening. It’s suggested that farmed land reflects more heat back into
the atmosphere than natural vegetation, and that we’ve almost reached the limit
of how much land we can safely use to produce food. With too many people
already in existence, and severe climate fluctuation just around the corner,
farming is bound to see some really dramatic changes in the years to come.

Unhelpful Information
DEFRA really do take the biscuit. We have at last had a letter telling us what
our entitlement to the new Single Payments Scheme amounts to. It’s the first
confirmation since we applied last May that we’re actually entitled to anything.
However there’s a catch to it. The letter, which is unsigned, is obviously a
circular with our name printed at the top. It explains at some length that
we are one of a significant number of applicants, whose claim has not been
fully validated. The word ‘validate’ occurs twelve times - I looked it up in the
dictionary to make sure it didn’t have some hidden meaning I wasn’t aware of.
Don’t get me wrong. We’re delighted to have something solid through the
post at last after the smoke signals we’ve been getting all winter. I don’t
mind reading through the best part of two pages to be told that we are among
thousands of farms still to be checked, and please not to contact staff, which
will hinder them getting on with the job, but to examine carefully the enclosed
statement of entitlements and report any errors immediately in writing. The
DEFRA official who managed to pad out that sentence to two pages is a genius
in the wrong job.
The enclosed statement is as short as the letter is long. It tells us how
many acres we’ve applied for and how many euros per acre we may receive.
Just that – two numbers and no explanation as to how they were calculated.
There is an extra sentence telling us to note that there are validation (no.13!)
checks outstanding, so this statement may be subject to change. The acreage
is correct, but how many euros per acre is not so simple, since our application
was based mainly on the number of cattle and sheep on the farm five years ago.
Enclosed with this is an eleven-page leaflet to help us understand the information contained in our entitlement statement. It is obviously the work of
the author of the letter – there can’t be two geniuses in the same government
department. But it does at least give us one bit of useful information – the
value to use in converting euros to pounds. We calculate from this that our
entitlement looks roughly right, so we shall be leaving DEFRA in peace for
now.
However, there is a sting in the tail of the letter, reminding us that all this
should be read in conjunction with the scheme rules, with which we should have
made ourselves familiar. We’ve had so many handbooks on the subject during
the last year that I’ve taken to just flipping through the contents and leaving it
to Jim to absorb the fine detail, since he’ll be dealing with the army of inspectors
who are likely to descend on us. But in case they arrive unannounced, I felt
314

Mar 15th

Muddled Views on Badgers

that, that following this letter, I should at least be equipped to stand in for
him. I therefore took DEFRA’s latest 74-page handbook, the 2006 edition of
Cross Compliance for England, as a bedtime read the other night.
If you think I must have been well asleep by page five, you couldn’t be
more wrong. The more I got into it, the more riveting it became. It starts
off by reminding us that this is not the definitive set of regulations, so it’s no
good hoping we won’t have to read another edition next year. The introduction
warns of three more directives to be introduced in 2007. I must look out our
first edition – it may one day be valuable.
It also makes clear straight away that most of the regulations already exist
in law. I soon lost count of how many times a paragraph begins with the words
“these rules reinforce existing legislation”. A payment penalty for infringement
will not excuse us from the probability of also finding ourselves in court, which
seems rather like being punished twice for the same offence.
I can’t resist ending with a couple of way-out examples that don’t make any
sense. There’s a list of about 100 birds that are protected by law. There is also
a list of prohibited means of killing such birds. It seems there is a penalty for
killing a barn owl, but if you do kill it, you mustn’t use a crossbow. Similarly
there’s a list of animals that must not be allowed to escape or grow in the wild,
which includes the grey squirrel. We’re going to have a job to avoid breaking
that rule. A suitably edited edition of this handbook would be a best seller.

March 15th
Muddled Views on Badgers
We seem, in recent years, to have been plagued by pontificating professors advising government or alarming the public with wildly exaggerated statements
on farming problems, about which they have very little, if any, practical experience. Who will forget the dire predictions of Professor Lacey at the height
of the BSE disaster? Or forgive Professor King’s advisory committee for the
contiguous cull policy during the foot and mouth outbreak? Unbelievably, it
has happened once again.
The Government has just completed a public consultation on the possibility
of a badger cull to control bovine TB in cattle. And what has been the most
telling statement which has caused a huge public outcry and which may influence
an eventual decision by DEFRA – why, the completely erroneous conclusion
reached by Professor Bourne at the end of the Krebs badger culling trials, for
which he was responsible.

Professor Bourne has stated that a cull, to be effective, would have to cover
a very wide area indeed – some hundreds of square kilometres for each TB hot
spot. In Devon and Cornwall, where the disease is now nearly endemic, this has
naturally caused outrage, with eminent naturalists like Sir David Attenborough
arguing that the scientific evidence appears to be against such a cull.
But what is the scientific evidence? Professor Bourne found that, during the
trials, attempting to kill all badgers in a particular area resulted in the spread of
TB further afield, with infected badgers being dispersed into adjoining territory
- the ripple effect, as it’s called. In coming to his conclusions, he seems to
have completely overlooked what any farmer could have pointed out, that the
method of killing badgers in the trials could hardly have been better devised to
scatter diseased badgers than if that had been the original intention.
When I first came to Devon, my local doctor had two young badgers cubs,
which he had hand-reared. Regrettably I never got around to seeing them, but
he was always enthusing about what delightful and intelligent pets they had
become. Years later, a friend of ours also reared an orphaned badger, which
again behaved very like a cat or dog. Watching badgers in the wild, which
we have always been fortunate enough to do here on the farm, it is obvious
that as a mammal, they are more family-orientated even than dogs or cats. To
expect that catching and holding badgers in live cage-traps near a sett for a few
hours and then shooting them, however humanely, would do other than frighten
horribly the remaining badgers in that group, is plain stupid.
I know the Krebs trials were intended to measure the extent of TB infection
in badgers, and in that it has confirmed our worst fears. But to make an
assessment based in the hope that an intelligent mammal would hang around
its home ground waiting its turn, when most of its kin had suffered a pretty
nasty end, and then call that scientific evidence is bordering on the criminal.
If we have to cull badgers, and in the worst scenarios, where a farm cannot
over a period of years get clear of TB, regrettably there is no other option, then
a cull must take out all the badgers on that one farm. And they all need to
be culled simultaneously. That one farm would have to be kept free of badgers
until TB in the cattle had been eradicated - the exact reverse of a ripple effect.
There is no need for further trials or even further evidence. It has been done
before successfully and avoids taking out any more badgers than is absolutely
necessary, and involves only the one farm.
I realize that how this is done is a very emotive subject. Snaring, trapping or
even shooting I find unacceptable, except in extreme cases. The most humane
way of killing a family of badgers simultaneously is by gassing the entire sett.
Put like that sounds horrifying, and I wouldn’t suggest it if we were talking
316

about using cyanide, which is now quite rightly banned. There is a much better
gas available today that is around us every time we drive into town – carbon
monoxide. It is a sleep inducing gas, and would take out the entire sett without
disturbing or poisoning other wildlife. If it was down to me and had to be done,
that would be my preference, and I think I speak for many other farmers.

March 22nd
Peck of March Dust
There’s been a cruel east wind buffeting the farm for the last ten days, drying
up the pastures and keeping spring at bay. There’ll be no early turn out for
the cattle this year. We have bedding straw for only a few more weeks, but
thankfully plenty of corn and more than enough hay. And now that we’re
organic, surplus hay to carry over to next winter may well be a godsend if this
weather continues. The ewes and lambs have been moved into the new red clover
and ryegrass leys, which were under-sown in the spring barley last year. With
a late harvest, these leys were never grazed in the autumn and went through
the winter over-proud. With the very late spring, this again is opportune, the
extra grass boosting the ewes’ milk just when the lambs most need it.
But that’s the problem with going organic; we can’t rely on luck in future.
Last year at this time, we were spreading our very modest 50 units of chalkbased nitrogen per acre, more or less as we have done all the years we’ve been
here. Sometimes in an early spring, we might have got away without needing
any bag nitrogen at all to get growth off to a good start, but on our light land
there was always a risk that without a decent bit of rain in April and May,
we could be in trouble later in the summer. That early fertilizer acted as an
insurance policy against adverse weather.
Buying in additional winter-feed is bad enough normally, but the cost of
having to buy in organic winter-feed would, I presume, be prohibitive. The
answer, of course, is to make sure that for the next five years, while we are
committed to remaining organic, we always keep a reserve of winter fodder
from one year to the next - much as we did in the old days, when it was normal
to have at least one rick of hay and a small clamp of mangolds in reserve against
summer drought or a wet haymaking.
And when I think of those days, I also remember that this bone chilling
March weather, which I’m complaining about now, was actually the best conditions we could hope for then to get our spring tilling done. “A peck of dust
in March is worth a king’s ransom”, as the saying goes. And as a saying it does
seem to have gone. No longer do we need at least ten days to break the winter
317

2006
plough to a decent seedbed. Now, one pass with a modern tractor-combination
of cultivator, drill and harrow and the job is done. If I went and stood on our
hill today, I doubt if there would be sight or sound of a tractor working arable
ground. In the 50s and 60s, there would have been plumes of dust blowing
down wind from fields on every farm in the district - there are at least 30 farms
visible from up there. And the gearbox-groan of Fordson tractors would have
reverberated from dawn to dusk through every valley.
I recall complimenting a neighbour on a beautiful seedbed he was preparing
for dredge corn. He explained that he had been over the field twice with a
cultivator and six times with the harrows, but the weather wouldn’t hold forever,
so it would have to do. The little grey Fergie he was using was hardly heavy on
fuel consumption, and he still was left with fertiliser spreading, drilling, and a
final harrowing and rolling, but I wonder what the comparison would be with
the fuel used on that field today.
Which takes me to wondering about how much extra tractor work Jim may
be obliged to do if we need to revert to rotational farming. Shorter leys and
more arable crops would ensure enough feed for our present level of cattle and
sheep numbers. We are hardly intensive as it is, but there is a lower limit
to what is economically worthwhile. We may well end up using more fuel
that way, than was used by the fertiliser manufacturers producing our meagre
requirements of nitro chalk. I can see Jim having to work a damn sight harder
farming organically, to produce the same amount of beef and lamb. That may
be worthwhile if the public are prepared to pay more, but will the farm be
chucking the same amount of pollution into the environment as it was before.

March 29th
Time for a Tough Approach
Are there changes ahead for the National Farmers Union? I sincerely hope so.
We have a new President in Peter Kendall, who has just completed his first 30
days in office, so it’s early days yet, but I’m expecting great things. I say that
to myself every time the presidency changes hands – I’m the eternal optimist,
but I regret to say that I’m nearly always disappointed.
I suppose the real reason for my constant dissatisfaction with the NFU is
something that no president can be expected to change. It probably derives
from the years immediately after the war when it represented farmers in what
almost amounted to a partnership with government in the drive to raise food
production. The annual price review negotiations of those days gave the NFU
a standing in the eyes of the public, so that it came to be regarded as the
318

Mar 29th

Time for a Tough Approach

unchallenged voice of farming. To a certain extent that image still persists.
The NFU is sometimes criticised in the media for pursuing a course that is not
in the public interest, as if it were some public body beholden to the nation.
That attitude even exists within its own hierarchy – the assumption that with a
fair wind and a minimum of controversy, an outgoing president can confidently
expect a knighthood.
The reality, and something that our leaders seem to find difficult to swallow,
is that the NFU represents no one other than its members. If enough of us
cancelled our subscriptions overnight, the NFU would rapidly disappear. And
that would be a disaster, because we desperately need a strong organisation
today as never before.
So what are my hopes for Peter Kendall’s presidency? A month ago I would
have said there were three areas of the NFU’s work that need immediate attention – communication, regulation and competition. The first has been addressed
by the appointment of our own Anthony Gibson as the national communications director, although I believe this had been decided before Peter Kendall
took office.
Regulation, or rather over-regulation, I accept, is an extremely difficult problem to deal with, because it’s not just us farmers that are being choked by it.
It’s a ‘dry rot’ pervading every aspect of day-to-day life. For example, last year
the NFU very successfully, with countless meetings and hours of staff time,
helped us through the labyrinthine process of completing our Single Farm Payments applications. But it should never have been necessary; we had already
instructed our leaders at local NFU meetings not to accept Beckett’s botch-up
scheme as being too complicated, unworkable and unfair compared with the
other farming regions in the UK and in Europe.
And so it has proved, and as an NFU, we failed. But I expect Peter Kendall
to use this fiasco to put down a marker for the future about the folly of not
listening to farmers over impending regulation. I don’t give a hoot how unpopular he makes himself with Margaret Beckett, even to the extent of becoming
unwelcome at No.10. I am sure the membership will back him, and I’ve no
doubt it would strike a chord with the general public as well. We give in to red
tape all too easily.
My third concern, competition, relates particularly to the supermarkets and
the way in which the NFU attempts to loosen their stranglehold on farming. I
hope it is brave enough to make a complete policy change in future and stop
having any direct dealings with them whatsoever. That may seem a very strange
suggestion, but we don’t seem to be getting anywhere by talking. Why, in this
319

2006
new era of unsubsided food production, does the NFU need to get involved in
the commercial business of its members anyway?
In fact if it were not involved at all, it could do what I think it should
be doing, which is monitoring very closely where individual supermarkets are
stepping out of line and misleading shoppers on the provenance of what is on
their shelves. Lets have the ‘Asda’s and ‘Tesco’s of this world worried about
what the NFU might expose next as misleading labelling, or imported products
which have been grown in a way that would be illegal in Britain, or have travelled
halfway round the world needlessly to get here. And let’s have an NFU official
checking the supermarket shelves openly, pencil and notebook in hand. Getting
banned from the store would make a good headline in itself.
As you can see, I’m obviously all for a much more confrontational approach
by our new president. We’ve been pussyfooting around far too long.

Rubbish About Payments
There was a strange ‘letter to the editor’ in the March edition of Farming
Link, (DEFRA news for farmers and growers), which I can’t let pass without
comment. It purported to come from a journalist, a D. Jordan of Torquay in
Devon. He or she has, for research reasons, been reading farming journals for
several months, and has quickly become familiar with one of the most repeated
complaints – that DEFRA is out of touch with farming. Jordan goes on to
wonder how far farming is in touch with the concerns of the general public and
the realities of 21st century business, and comments that “Recent changes have
at least ended the questionable practice of consumers paying twice for their food
– once when they buy the product and again to subside its production”.
The letter continues at some length along similar lines and ends by suggesting that “until farming sees itself as a business rather than a cultural heritage,
it cannot solve the challenges facing it”. Now, I’ve no idea which branch of
the media D. Jordan works for or how long he or she has been in journalism.
Nor do I understand why the letter was sent to Farming Link, a free monthly
information paper circulated only to farmers to inform them about DEFRA
activities. If I were being really cynical, I might suppose that D. Jordan was
in reality a plant, allowing DEFRA staff to have a go at farmers for a change
in a non-attributable way – but of course DEFRA would never stoop to such a
stratagem.
It was sheer chance that I saw the letter at all. After reading the front page,
with its headline “Full payments on track for farmers”, with a reassuring state320

Apr 5th

Rubbish About Payments

ment from Johnston McNeill, the recently sacked Chief Executive of the Rural
Payments Agency, and the promise of next year’s application forms reaching
us by the end of March, neither of which have yet materialised, I very nearly
threw the paper unread straight in the bin. However I’m glad I persevered.
The perception that consumers have been paying twice for their food in the
past needs squashing once and for all. Nor do I know of any working farmers
who have seen themselves as part of a cultural heritage – quite the reverse,
it’s the public who have tended to see us as jolly yokels, while we have been
going about the business of making a living, producing food under whatever
politically devised framework that has been in place at the time. In fact, it
could be argued that the new system of rural support, which is causing such
havoc in its introduction, is an attempt to reward farmers for developing the
cultural aspect of their businesses – the maintenance of a pastoral countryside
– while removing any direct payments for actually farming. It will be the first
time the latter has happened since the war.
As most competent journalists are fully aware, farmers have never been paid
twice for producing food. The system we’ve worked under has, in effect, been to
pay us in two stages. First, at the farm gate at a value that has been dictated
by world prices, prices that are based on the surplus of other countries, often
at well below the cost of production in the UK. And subsequently, a top-up
support payment entirely at the discretion of government, effectively regulating
how much of our food it has been in the national interest to grow at home.
By using the various subsidy systems to control farm incomes, a balance has
been struck – although some times less accurately than others (who will forget
butter-mountains and wine-lakes). It has allowed government to control the cost
of food, which as a proportion of national income, has declined pretty steeply
in recent years.
That top-up payment has now, at a stroke, been removed. I’m delighted
I’ve been farming long enough to see it happen. Perhaps it will at last be
obvious that it is not farmers that have been featherbedded over the years, but
the nation’s shoppers. In future, we’ll need to show that good home-produced
food has a realistic value without any help from the taxpayer. That shouldn’t
be too difficult here in the southwest where we are fortunate in having a wellinformed media and a very supportive public. If the record attendance figures
for the Exeter Festival of South West Food and Drink, which took place over
the weekend, are anything to go by, the job is well started.

What Is Natural England?
I’m not going to write about what is obviously the most depressing farming
news of last week – the arrival of bird ‘flu on our shores. It’s not that I’m
indifferent to the plight of free-range poultry farming neighbours if the disease
should happen to reach the southwest; it’s just that I’m fed up with the continual
doom mongering over one farm animal disease after another, which assails us
on a daily basis.
Instead I’m going to refer to some news that surfaced at the weekend, which
was probably viewed with a mixture of approval and apathy by the public at
large, but filled me with some alarm. It was headlined “Natural England to
protect countryside - new Government agency pledges to make ‘magnificent’
difference”. Apparently this new body has been formed out of the Countryside Agency, the Rural Development Service and English Nature, and will be
launched in October. Its new chief executive Dr Helen Phillips says she wants
to generate a close connection between communities and the environment and
focus on ‘landscape scale’ initiatives. What on God’s earth does she mean by
that?
Although I’ve heard of the three Government departments that have been
shuffled to produce this bastard offspring, I confess that, without looking it
up, I don’t actually know in detail what they’ve been doing up to now. I find
it difficult, therefore, to visualise how ‘Natural England’ will do, whatever it
is they’ve been doing, any better. What alarms me is the title that this new
agency has been saddled with. Doesn’t anyone in the corridors of power yet
understand that the English countryside is the most unnatural landscape that
it’s possible to visualise? It has evolved over the last 500 years for the sole
purpose of producing food and fuel, aside from the artificial parkland of the
landed gentry, and more recently the National Parks.
Whatever Dr Phillips is intending to do in the next five years to make
this magnificent difference in protecting and enhancing the landscape, as she is
promising, I hope she is aware that without a profitable farming industry, she’ll
be spitting in the wind, if I may put it crudely.
A very good example of this is the current management of farmland hedgerows.
A view of the Devon countryside from any high vantage point has changed for
the worse over recent years - that is a very personal opinion, and derives from
how I remember Devon looking when I first arrived getting on for 60 years
ago. Someone half my age might well disagree with me, but they will never
322

Problems of Going Organic

have seen a Devon landscape that existed before the invention of chainsaws and
hedge trimmers.
In those days all the hedges were a sequence of varying heights, from the
newly laid-in to the full 25 years growth, with here and there a few grassy
banks that were hand trimmed in July. They had to be like that – there was no
realistic way of cutting off by hand the top of a woody hedge after a full years
growth. And they were the main source of the farmhouse fuel supply. Without
a uniform hedge height, the result was a diverse and attractive landscape, plus
a much more varied habitat for wild life.
Today, from a distance every hedgerow looks the same – a thin ribbon marking out the boundaries of each field, with here and there the odd token tree.
Even close up, it is not as easy to recognise the wide variety of species that
make up our hedges. And what do they produce – pretty damn all.
We are currently halfway through a ten-year government stewardship scheme,
the most valuable part of which is the management of our hedgerows. To date
about two miles of hedge-laying has been completed, which, with the accompanying banking up and protective fencing, is no cheap undertaking. The grant
aid has made all the difference, but I am bothered that there is now very little
incentive to allow the cycle to begin again. Jim has left a great many sapling
trees, more than is perhaps necessary, which will enhance the view, but unless
there is money to be made out of farming, the simple answer is to keep our
hedges trimmed on a regular basis.
And that is obviously what is happening all over Devon. There is no real
stewardship incentive to allow hedges to grow up again. Perhaps Dr Phillips
will change all that.

April 26th
Problems of Going Organic
It has been a good week and it has been a bad week, which is how life often is
on a farm.
The warmer weather has at last arrived. The recurring call of a cuckoo has
been echoing around our woods lately, a sound we’ve heard only sporadically in
recent years. The swallows are back wheeling overhead and checking their nests
in the outbuildings. And our barn owls are probably already incubating eggs if
the foraging of the male is anything to go by - he is about in broad daylight,
starting with a couple of turns round the house at about six in the evening after
a brief rest on the garden fence to plan his route.
323

2006
If all that isn’t enough to lift the spirits, Jim has been progressively turning
out the cows and calves, and it’s the sight of cattle out grazing the pastures
that really signals the approach of summer. Thursday was the day of our routine annual Soil Association inspection, which went smoothly enough, although
the inspector, with good humour, managed to give himself an electric shock,
mistakenly using a joke biro of my grandson’s as he signed the necessary forms.
The week then went rapidly downhill. Since our early days here, we have
always allowed our animals free access to mineral licks, having been advised that
the soils in the district were known to be low in trace elements. The first vet we
employed emphasised the importance of keeping minerals always available as a
precaution against grass staggers, fertility problems and the occasional case of
wooden tongue in the cows. We have progressed through about four generations
of vets since then without ever considering a change in management and with
relatively few problems that could be blamed solely on mineral shortage.
All that changed under organic rules, which allow some free access to minerals, but only if it can be shown that cattle need them, and then only specially
formulated organic licks that do not contain trace elements. So for the last
twelve months, the cattle have been deprived, and incidentally appeared to
have been doing well enough without them. But it seems we were storing up
trouble. Jim had discussed with the organic inspector, with particular reference
to minerals, the case of a suddenly recumbent sick calf being treated by our vet
with blanket antibiotics for lack of any obvious symptoms. On Friday morning,
a number of two-month-old calves from the same batch of twenty, which had
been thriving until then, were suddenly looking very sick indeed.
The cows and calves all had to return to the buildings, and Jim spent the day
firstly with the vet taking blood samples and injecting precautionary antibiotics,
and then injecting or dosing them all with selenium. It appears the calves
probably have White Muscle Disease, caused by a serious deficiency of selenium
in their mothers’ milk, which will take some months to correct, and from which
some may never fully recover. In all the years, we have never before had to
treat so many calves at one time for an illness. If that’s what going organic is
all about, we are not very impressed.
Jim has been worried for some time now that we might eventually run into
problems and has been seeking derogation from the Soil Association to allow
us to provide minerals which include trace elements, at least through our transitional period, but they have been singularly slow in agreeing to his request,
unless evidence for need can be provided. They will certainly get that now.
The week hadn’t finished with us. On Saturday morning, we received our
application forms for the 2006 single farm payments scheme. We are still waiting
324

May 3rd

When the Taps Run Dry

to hear about our 2005 application, but at least we could get next years forms
completed – or so I thought until I opened the envelope. We have been sent a
blank or unpopulated form, as DEFRA calls it, with 13 pages missing.
Saturday wasn’t all bad, however. Jenny and I spent a most enjoyable
evening at the diamond wedding anniversary celebrations of Brian and Olive
Down, at Black Torrington, where they have always lived and farmed. The
village hall was full of farming friends and acquaintances we have known for
many years, but see all too rarely these days. I never knew so many of them
could sing – the Newton St Petrock Male voice choir, which included Brian, had
the hair tingling on the back of my neck.

May 3rd
When the Taps Run Dry
I never have much difficulty finding our car in a car park. It is invariably
the dirtiest one there – two-toned, a red colour above the door handles and,
depending on the season, a dust or mud colour below. I don’t have much
conscience about not washing it; I never have been very enthusiastic about
self-perpetuating jobs, like shaving or mowing the lawn.
However, when a friend pointed out how filthy the car was as I bought my
paper in the village this morning, I replied that my green credentials must be
showing, since I didn’t believe in wasting water. Driving home, I reflected that
this justification for laziness was pretty feeble since, like most farms in these
days of strict bio-security, we do have a pressure washer, which dramatically
reduces the amount of water needed to wash a car.
But there is an element of truth in my excuse. We really don’t know how
global warming and climate change will affect our weather. It’s quite possible
that rainfall patterns will be the most dramatic initial change to affect the UK,
and with our prodigious use of water, could we survive two successive years like
1976 without serious consequences?
Nearly every livestock farm today would grind to a halt if water suddenly
stopped coming out of the taps. Not so many years ago, every farm had a pond
located somewhere in the vicinity of the farm buildings. Ours has long gone
under concrete. We are now almost totally dependant on mains water, with
no back up if the unthinkable happened. I say almost because we do have a
small lake at the bottom of our front field, which would probably be enough to
see the cattle through one drought year. But that was no thanks to the river
authorities of thirty years ago.
325

2006
We had landscaped a piece of sloping ground to build a silage barn and
cattle shed, and the large amount of hard shale that resulted was spread over
some very wet low-lying ground. In order to provide some topsoil to cover it
while the bulldozer was still with us, we decided to dig out a lake purely as an
attractive feature visible from the farmhouse. We have never regretted it – the
wildlife it attracts exceeded our expectations, and it has remained full although
supplied with little more than the rainwater which falls on the roofs of our farm
buildings.
However, within a year of making the finishing touches to the banks, the
heavy hand of officialdom arrived in the shape of a little man clutching a clipboard. He was not best pleased - the river authority of those days had not
given us permission to do anything like that, if every farmer dug lakes the river
Creedy would run dry, had I no concern for trout spawning, what about the
cattle drinking down river in dry summers, and so on. I pointed out that I
had not dammed up the stream, and the water was ours since it came off our
farm buildings. That had him going again – no water belonged to us, we could
merely use it as it passed through us and in any case we had not had a hydrological engineer certify that the banks were safe enough to prevent a collapse
and sudden surge down river with possible danger to life. We must remove the
lake forthwith and apply for a permit through the proper channels, and do the
thing properly. I am not exaggerating.
By this time my dander was up. I was not about to concede tamely to this
‘pocket Hitler’. I had dug a hole in the ground and if it had filled up with
water that belonged to him, he could have it. But he was not to interfere with
my property in any way in removing it. I was marching off when he called me
back, saying that changed everything. If he could report that I needed the soil
that had been removed for agricultural purposes, and the resulting area had
filled with water by chance, all would be well. Had I thought of stocking it with
trout? He went away a happy man.
Many years later, we had another visit from the river authority checking
out a pollution incident further down stream from us. They noted our lake and
congratulated us on having a very good defence against possible effluent escape
from our farm buildings. Perhaps in years to come, we may be held up as an
example of foresighted planning against the possibility of the taps running dry.

What a Very Real Waste

May 10th
What a Very Real Waste
Five totally wasted years. That is the most constructive phrase I can think of
to describe Margaret Beckett’s time as our agriculture minister. It would be
easy to slate her for the shambles in which she has left her department, for the
revulsion she has generated among farmers nearing the end of their tethers over
the current payments disaster, or even for her dismal record on environmental
issues, the only aspect of her responsibilities about which she appeared to show
any enthusiasm at all.
In fact, that has been a big part of the problem, Beckett’s complete lack of
zest for the job. This was immediately apparent from the disdainful manner
with which she dealt with the media and the supercilious expression she adopted
at farming conferences, the only occasions when I saw her in person. On her
appointment, she did exactly what the Prime Minister ordered, battening down
the hatches at the height of the government’s embarrassment over it’s handling
of the foot and mouth outbreak. Unfortunately for all of us in the countryside,
she was then left for the next five years more or less to her own devices, provided
she kept rural issues out Tony Blair’s hair.
The manner of her going shows what a mess she made of it. Why else has
she been promoted to one of the highest offices in the land, one to which I
would have thought she was even less suited, except to obscure the wasteland
she leaves behind? Why else have three of her junior ministers been summarily
axed, leaving only the most junior, Ben Bradshaw, to show the new team where
the amenities are to be found in their new offices?
Rather than dwell on Beckett’s actual shortcomings, about which there are
many better placed than me to judge, I prefer to think of what might have been,
in the hope that our new rural minister will rapidly get us back on the right
road. Since I started farming, twenty agriculture ministers have come and gone
– some good, some bad and some frankly indifferent. I can remember them all
pretty clearly. Several I met personally, either in an official capacity, or, on one
or two occasions I’m forced to admit, with a policeman at my elbow to ensure
that my words spoke louder than any actions I might be contemplating.
In my opinion, the best of them was the first, Tom Williams, who held office
for six years and implemented the agriculture reforms of the first labour government after the war. I would put in second place our own Derick HeathcoatAmory, minister from 1954 to 1958, who brought in capital grants to begin
the essential task of modernising the nations farm buildings. He was promoted
to Chancellor of the Exchequer, the only occasion an agricultural minister has
327

2006
moved on to high office, instead of the usual sideways step of a lesser ministry
or the obscurity of the backbenches. That is until now, with the appointment
of Margaret Beckett as Foreign Secretary. Strangely, she was exceeded only by
Tom Williams in the number of years she was in charge of agriculture, (Fred
Peart managed six years, but in two stages ten years apart), which is why,
although I can recall at least three farm ministers who were equally inept for
shorter periods, I put her firmly at the bottom of my list.
Just think what Beckett could have achieved in those five years. She was
given the task of setting up a new rural ministry, as was Tom Williams after the
war, and Heathcoat-Amory when the Min. of Food was merged with MAFF. I
realise that agriculture no longer has the priority it once had, but what a golden
opportunity has been lost to show how government can successfully look after
the environment and rural affairs in a small, overpopulated and largely urban
country in the 21st century.
We could by now be producing enough biofuels to meet our carbon emissions targets, instead of just starting down that road behind the rest of Europe.
We could have been virtually clear of bovine TB in cattle with five years concerted action against all sources of infection. We might even have achieved
the unthinkable, and become accustomed to simple paperwork that required no
70-page booklets as mandatory reading. In short, Beckett’s legacy should have
been a DEFRA to be proud of. Instead she leaves us with something about as
useful to a farmer as a maggoty ewe, the stench of which, if there is any justice,
will cling to her for the remainder of her political career.

Nasty Shock Averted
The two people in the car looked as if they were wondering whether they had
come to the right place.
As I watched from the window, they eventually got out, clutching a slim
booklet and a bundle of papers. My heart sank. A fortnight ago I would have
said they looked horribly like Beckett’s bloodhounds but I suppose I should
now be calling them Rooker’s rozzers. I know that’s being a little unfair on
Lord Rooker, our new farm minister, after his abject and long overdue apology
to farmers on TV last Sunday for DEFRA’s shambolic handling of the single
farm payments scheme. He is after all in no way responsible for what has
gone before, but now has to clear up the mess. At least he comes to the job
with some ministerial experience of matters agricultural, the first time that’s
happened since Labour came to power.

Nasty Shock Averted

Meanwhile the couple were approaching the backdoor. I mentally raced
through all the possible farming acts and omissions, as described in the cross
compliance handbook, they might uncover, which could be used to claw back
some of the long awaited cash we received ten days ago. Were all the farm
records bang up to date? Had any of the cattle lost an ear-tag in the last few
days? Would they find that we had ploughed a few inches into the two-metre
boundary strip beside a hedge? Or, horror of horrors, might they discover a
lark’s nest that I’d inadvertently trampled on while counting the sheep? I am
of course exaggerating, but only a little.
My visitors turned out not to be DEFRA inspectors at all, just a pair of
Jehovah’s Witnesses carrying a bible and some religious tracts. I was so relieved
I nearly invited them in for a cup of coffee. But should I have been worrying
anyway? We have passed our ‘Little Red Tractor’ and our ‘Organic Status’
inspections already this year, with no apparent faults. I’m pretty sure we’re
doing everything asked of us to justify our single farm payment. But would the
public know or care if we weren’t? That is the really worrying aspect of this
whole well publicised government fiasco – failure to pay farmers large sums of
money by the due date.
If you believed in a conspiracy theory, you might suppose the government’s
intention all along had been to precipitate a media debate into why all this
money was owed to farmers in the first place. What better way to give Gordon
Brown ammunition to slash the CAP budget? Unfortunately this may be the
end result, but I can’t think it was intended – every government department
seems hell-bent on self-destruction at the moment, not just DEFRA.
When the new farm payments scheme was introduced last year, farming
pundits were exhorting us to look on these payments as totally separate to our
businesses – capital to invest in the new world of subsidy-free food production or
put into piggy-banks for our early retirement. We were strongly advised against
using them to shore up unprofitable enterprises. The man in the street might
therefore be wondering why we are in such a strop about a few months delay in
receiving this largesse. He hears about the low prices being paid to farmers by
the supermarkets, and can only assume we are going on much as before. Which
of course we are, since it’s impossible to switch off food production overnight.
But, although it may take some years, the agricultural industry will eventually
change course, and it’s vital for the well being of the countryside that this new
payments scheme succeeds. So are we doing enough to make sure the money is
being focused where it’s most needed to make the transition?
I read of a case the other day of someone claiming to have at last received
his or her full payment – the grand sum of £75. What sort of a message does
329

2006
that send the public? I don’t begrudge the smallholder in question getting
what amounts to a blowout at the weekend, but think what it cost to make
this payment – the printing and postage on the instruction booklets alone must
have been nearly more than that, and the expense of the inevitable visit by a
two-man team of DEFRA inspectors, to check that it’s not a five acre extension
to a flower garden being financed by the taxpayer, will give the media a field
day.

May 31st
Old Cow Welfare Lunacy
At 6.30 last Wednesday morning, Jim and I found ourselves trying to persuade
a very reluctant 19-year old suckler cow, still fit but at the end of her breeding
life, with fifteen fine beef calves to show for it, to enter a lorry for a final and
totally unnecessary journey to extinction and incineration. We had to resort
to the time-honoured method of linking arms behind her rear end, and gently
half-push, half-carry her aboard.
Sadly, our oldest cow had come to the end of the road. I say sadly, not
because her time had come, but because the end of the road for her was in an
abattoir fifty miles away. As the lorry disappeared up the lane, Jim turned to me
saying, “Where’s the compassion in farming gone? There’s no good reason for
an old cow to have to leave the farm like that, just to end up in an incinerator”.
And I absolutely agree with him and so, I’m sure, does every other livestock
farmer in the country.
I was a member of the southwest regional committee of NFU office holders,
when John Hoskin, of Maiden Castle Farm, the Dorset chairman, proposed that,
with Government and farmers sharing the cost, the meat from cattle slaughtered
at over thirty months of age be taken out of the food chain. That was exactly
ten years ago this month. It was a defining moment in the horror story that
was BSE and it’s impossible to say where we might be now, if this action hadn’t
been taken. We have now reached the final stages of this grisly business with
over eight million cattle carcases destroyed, and a final half million cattle left
to dispose of as they come to the end of their lives. These are all breeding
animals, the majority of them in suckler herds with up to ten more good years
of producing and rearing calves ahead of them.
It seems that DEFRA is now anxious to wash its hands of this whole affair
and get as many of these older cattle eliminated as soon as possible. They are
therefore limiting paying their share of the value of the carcase, set at about
£200, to just three more years, in the hope that we will clear out our herds
330

Jun 7th

Flaming June at Long Last

while we have the chance. In our own case, it won’t succeed. About half our
suckler cows are ten years old or older, many of them in their prime. To get rid
of all but the very oldest at less than a third of their breeding value would be
stupid. Perhaps that is DEFRA’s real intention – to pay as little as possible.
Under the rules of this new disposal scheme, which replaces the Over Thirty
Months Scheme, we are required to send all these older cows to a dedicated
abattoir. In the past, with a vet’s agreement on welfare grounds, cattle could
be slaughtered on farm. But since Jan 24th, the rules have changed and for the
new scheme, only animals that have suffered an accident, like breaking a leg,
can be killed at home. What sort of lunacy is this? If they are worried a few
animals might be unfit for human consumption, for goodness sake, there is only
a finite number of these animals and none are going into the food chain anyway.
There’s worse to come. There are so few abattoirs dedicated to dealing
solely with cattle born before August 1996, that some animals are having to
travel very long distances. Once there, they are slaughtered, tested for BSE
and processed in the normal way into hides, intestines and sides of beef. They
then travel onwards piecemeal to be rendered down. What a needless journey
and ridiculous expense compared with the cow that breaks a leg, is killed on
farm and removed by the nearest ‘fallen stock’ collector, tested for BSE, and
immediately incinerated whole.
In fact, with BSE now virtually eliminated, the ‘fallen stock’ collectors could
very adequately and much more humanely deal with all these older cattle over
the next ten years. The extra business might even help keep the costs of operating the existing government-funded National Fallen Stock Scheme to a minimum. The farm organisations proposed this course of action, but DEFRA
turned it down. In a sane world, for the sake of animal welfare, it should be
happening, but I suppose it’s just one more piece of evidence that, when it
comes to farming, sanity has fled the corridors of power.

June 7th
Flaming June at Long Last
Farmers shouldn’t have much to grumble about this week. That is unless they
are one of the unfortunate ones still awaiting their single farm payment; for them
the present situation is quite intolerable. But for the rest of us, the difficulties
of dealing with DEFRA are for the time being behind us, and the weather, that
other all-important farming hazard, could not have been kinder.
The wettest May for years has provided us with more grass on the farm
than I can remember. To have that followed immediately by a scorcher, a real
331

2006
flaming June, seems almost too good to be true. Every farmer round here
making silage, and most of them are, must be delighted with how quickly the
fields can be cleared while there is still moisture enough to get the grass growing
again. And more importantly, with how much fuel is being saved by the speed
of operations. The very sharp increase in the cost of farm diesel will make
catchy seasons in future more of a worry than they used to be, or is such typical
English weather a thing of the past, with global warming giving us a climate
more like southern France or Spain?
Without knowing what the rest of this summer has in store for us, I certainly
wouldn’t complain if what we’ve had so far becomes the norm. The blossom
and hedgerow flowers have been exceptional, and we have one summer pasture,
with a scattering of bluebells, buttercups, speedwell and wild red clover, that
would do justice to an alpine meadow. Surprisingly, fifty years ago the field was
a ferny brake, although I’ve no doubt it was cultivated in the distant past. The
difference this year is that, with such an abundance of grazing, the cattle didn’t
need the pasture until later than usual, allowing the wild flowers to bloom.
Unfortunately, with the deluge of grim predictions about global warming
assailing us daily, it looks as if this may be just another illustration of climate
change. How much are farmers contributing to the problem? We are generally
the scapegoats for anything to do with the environment. Do our tractors throw
out more exhaust fumes than they used to? Tractors today are certainly bigger
and more powerful than there were in the past, but their engines are cleaner
and more efficient. With the larger implements they handle, the time it takes to
get through the various tilling and harvesting operations has reduced out of all
proportion. We can’t do much about restricting the methane produced by our
cattle, or the fact that farmed land reflects more heat than natural vegetation,
but we are already growing alternate sources of energy, as well as producing
food more efficiently. And that’s where we run into problems, particularly with
people who live in the countryside, but are not involved in the rural economy.
If we use plastic sheeting or poly-tunnels, we are spoiling the appearance
of our fields. If we are prepared to accept wind turbines on our farms, we are
wrecking the view for miles around. If we grow miscanthus or willow for energy
production, nobody wants the necessary processing facility near them. I confess
that, in the abstract, I don’t much like them either, but, as a farmer, earning
a living, I know that whatever I do is bound to have a visual impact on the
environment. I am also very conscious that without a financial incentive, no
farmer can afford to do any of these things.
Although I doubt if these limited actions are going to make much longterm difference, is money the key to getting them accepted? For example, had
332

Jun 14th

No More Daisies in Fields

the residents of Winkleigh, who were opposed to a biomass generating station
being built in their village, been offered free electricity for the undoubted loss
in the value of their properties, would the vigour of their resistance have been
muted. Or again, if everyone living within sight of a wind turbine, got a hefty
allowance on his or her electricity bills, would wind farms be springing up all
over the place. It just might allow the rest of us to go on getting cheap holiday
flights for a few more years.
That may be a very cynical view of human nature, but if it helped to persuade the government to subsidise only those proposals that really work, it
would be worthwhile. After all, none of the eyesores we love to hate is permanent. If we do nothing, global warming almost certainly is.

June 14th
No More Daisies in Fields
She was a crossbred Charrolais cow, and she seemed unduly agitated that June
morning, but we decided to let Sherry rejoin the herd on their daily trek over
the hill to the neighbouring farm. This involved the cows walking, after morning
milking, the best part of a mile along an old drove road to their day’s grazing.
It was the drought year of 1976, and by mid-summer our farm was looking
like a desert. Our neighbours, friends for many years, had decided to give up
farming. Their dairy herd had been sold the previous autumn, and they were
making hay for sale on most of their acres. We were very welcome to the grazing
fields if we kept an eye on the contractors for them when they were away. The
offer was a lifeline we gladly accepted; in fact I sometimes wonder if we would
have survived without it.
Sherry was one of the few suckler cows we ran with the dairy herd at the
time. These multiple-suckled beef calves in the buildings during milking time.
The suckler cows were kept in with the calves for two or three days after calving
to settle them down, but Sherry’s behaviour after calving had seemed a little
odd. We had already searched the area carefully where she’d calved in case
she’d had twins, to no avail.
So it was that exactly 30 years ago, Sherry made her way back to the fields
where she had calved three days before. Once there, she went straight to a spot
under a hedge, in a different field to the one in which she had calved, to rouse
up a hefty Charrolais bull calf, identical to the one she’d just left a mile away
in our buildings. Nature never ceases to amaze me. The calf got up and started
suckling, as if it were quite normal to be born, presumably have an initial feed,
and be left hidden for three scorching hot days, before the return of mother.
333

2006
How it survived and how the cow went unerringly to where it was – there was
no vocal contact – I have no idea. We may have domesticated cattle thousands
of years ago, but the old survival instincts obviously die hard.
Jenny and I were reminded of this episode, as we walked the same track
on our way to see how well ‘Farm Sunday’ was doing. The Vere family’s farm,
our present neighbours, was one of the those that had opened to the public
this year for what is a great idea organised by LEAF (Linking Environment
and Farming) - to encourage as many farms as possible to share one national
open day. As Wendy Vere pointed out “If we’re being paid these days for doing
environmental work on our farms, it’s important the public get a chance to see
what great value they are getting for their money”. From the number of local
people there, the signs look good for it to become a successful annual event.
Being a beautiful summer’s day helped, with the countryside looking at it’s
greenest best. How different to that previous June, when we walked the route
twice daily, there and back with our cows. Everywhere the grass was shrivelling
up. There had been no rain for weeks and the cattle had to cross what in normal
times was a muddy ford in the substantial stream between the two farms. This
had dried out to six inches of dust, which rose into the air completely obscuring
the herd as they wound their way up the lane. Our poor old black and white
sheepdog, who believed it his duty to follow hard on their heels to keep them
moving, would arrive, spluttering and wheezing, an unrecognisable pale brown,
as he turned them into their fields for the day.
If we get another summer like that in the next few years, will there be a
national panic that global warming is finally upon us, or shall we assume as
we did then, that a repeat of that kind of summer is unlikely to recur in our
life time? Sherry went on to become one of the foundation cows of our present
suckler herd. She also, as it happens, was one of the last cows we gave a name
to. These days, when all cattle are obliged to have passports and ear- tag
numbers, the ‘daisies’ and ‘buttercups’ are slipping into the past, perhaps not
on all farms, but certainly on the purely commercial ones.

New Rules Hard to Swallow

June 21st
New Rules Hard to Swallow
The smell of wood smoke drifted gently on the evening air. As I leant on my
fork waiting for the flames to flare up, I could hear young tawny owls halfhooting awkwardly in the woods across the valley. Throwing together the outer
rim of unburnt brushwood onto the hot ashes of the day’s bonfire, while idly
ruminating on nothing in particular as the night closed in, was always one of
my favourite jobs. It was something I must have done countless times to avoid
the trouble of having to relight the fire the next morning to get rid of the small
bits of wood that might otherwise end up in the hay or silage.
On this occasion my thoughts not unnaturally turned to the new waste
regulations that have just been foisted onto us from May 15th. I confess I’m
not yet completely familiar with them. Even the definitions of what constitutes
waste on a farm seem strangely contradictory. I can see that materials like
plastic, broken asbestos, and hypodermic needles need to be disposed of safely,
but why, for instance, redundant farm machinery is classed as waste and can
only be stored on farm for twelve months, defeats me. Most of our old machinery
has lain about for years as an endless source of spares or weldable metal, until
eventually removed by a local scrap merchant. And how farmyard manure is
classed as fertiliser when spread on the farm where it’s produced, but becomes
waste when spread on any other farm, is even stranger.
But there are two items in the regulations that I find hard to swallow.
They concern material that has existed on farms since farming began – hedge
trimmings and ditch dredgings. Having to notify the authorities when dealing
with what is produced by maintaining field boundaries, is surely ridiculous. In
my book, cleaning out ditches on a regular basis and spreading the resulting
spoil back over the field is good husbandry. And burning the surplus brushwood
on a bonfire after laying a hedge is plain common sense. What else does the
Environment Agency think we are going to do with these materials? Even more
to the point, what does the Environment Agency want us to do with them? If
a farm has hedges and ditches, these procedures are bound to occur. So why do
we need to take out a licence, or, in these cases, apply for an exemption which is
merely the equivalent of a free licence, to do the unavoidable? I don’t yet know
how often we are expected to apply for these exemptions – every time we clean
a ditch or lay a hedge maybe? Or once a year? Or once and forever? I know
that if we don’t apply, an inspector is likely to descend on us to find out why
we haven’t done so. It would surely be simpler to just inform the Environment
Agency that our farm has hedges and ditches and leave it at that.
335

2006
It all seems a far cry from the old days. I don’t recall any restrictions
about cleaning out ditches, except that failure to do so could cause flooding
to a neighbour’s land, which might be actionable. But there were rules even
then about lighting fires – no bonfires within seventy feet (if my memory serves
me correctly) of a public highway. We had a village policeman once who was
mustard about that particular regulation – it also affected private gardens and
probably still does – and he always carried a long tape measure around as he
patrolled the parish on his bicycle. If he saw black smoke in the distance, you
could depend on it he would be there within minutes.
Looking back, that is really the difference between those days and today.
The village bobby was the law, he knew everyone on his patch, and everyone
knew him. And he was expected to be fully conversant with all the rules that
affected farming. I don’t normally view the past through rosy spectacles, but in
this instance I think something like these new waste regulations could have been
more effectively and smoothly introduced if we still had the law operating at
local level. And we would certainly have managed without licences, exemptions
and all the other red tape that we look like getting tied up in.

June 28th
Redundant at Sheep Shearing
This year, for the first time I can remember, sheep shearing passed me by
virtually unnoticed. In recent years I have at least assisted by rolling the fleeces,
sometimes being called on to keep the sheep penned up tight to the shearers,
and occasionally helping catch an unruly ewe that knew what was coming. This
time, Jim and Bev had the job well organised by adapting the cattle race, which
was put in last summer when we were repeatedly testing the cows for TB. By
the time I realised what the bleating was all about, sheep shearing was almost
over.
It’s a long time since I actually sheared a sheep myself. We’ve always run
a small flock to complement the cattle, the sheep keeping the pastures in good
order by winter grazing. Before the days of contract shearers, sheep shearing
was one of the two annual chores, the other being hand-hoeing roots, which I
rather dreaded. It wasn’t the actual task on each occasion that I disliked; in
fact as skills requiring a degree of precision, they were quite rewarding. The
trouble was that by the time my back stopped aching and I was beginning to
enjoy it, the job was finished.
I learned to shear when I first came here to Devon. My only previous
experience with sheep had been during my year as a farm apprentice, when I
336

Jun 28th

Redundant at Sheep Shearing

had the unenviable first job every morning, through a cold and muddy winter,
of resetting the sheep netting for the flock being folded across a field of swedes. I
can’t say the experience endeared me to sheep keeping, but since it appeared an
integral part of every Devon farm, and since everyone did their own shearing in
those days, I felt obliged to enrol in the classes run by the local Young Farmers
Club.
Our instructor was a neighbouring farmer, Fred Ayre, who although still in
his thirties, seemed to have a wealth of farming experience compared to the
young farmers sons and accompanying new comers like myself. I suspect we
were a pretty unruly bunch, but Fred was a pleasure to learn from. He started
us off by teaching us the basics with blade shears, just as sheep had been shorn
since farming began, and was still common practice on many farms in the early
1950s. From there, progressing to the use of mechanical clippers was an easy
step, but had the disadvantage in those early days of requiring a helper to
continuously turn a handle to provide motive power. Electrical driven clippers,
sheep handling tables and other refinements followed through the years to make
the job easier, but I never really took to it.
I learned a lot more from Fred than just shearing sheep. His approach to
the regular chores, which were pretty daunting to a novice farmer, was a lesson
in itself. For example, he obviously enjoyed shearing, but didn’t attempt to get
his flock shorn as quickly as possible, as I would have expected, but just tackled
ten or a dozen sheep in the cool of the evening after each day’s work. In that
way the shearing got done without disrupting the other weather controlled jobs
like hoeing and haymaking.
Fred soon moved on to the broader acres and better land of the Exe valley,
and I lost sight of him until quite recently. He is now retired and living in
Crediton where I often meet him at our monthly farmers market. Although
approaching ninety, he seems as hale and hearty as ever.
Within a few years of being taught by Fred to shear, I was at a Bath and
West Show, with a huge crowd of other farmers, watching a demonstration of
sheep shearing by Godfrey Bowen, the New Zealand world champion. He held
the record at the time of shearing 456 sheep in nine hours. To be able to shear
a sheep in little more than a minute, and keep on doing it, was something that
needed seeing to be believed.
The Bowen technique changed sheep shearing from a regular farm job that
we all learnt to do, to a professional occupation, initially involving teams coming
half way round the world every summer to shear the larger UK flocks. Today, I
would guess virtually all sheep are shorn by contractors, it being hardly worthwhile maintaining shearing equipment for such a one off job. Tomorrow, with
337

2006
the value of wool hardly meeting the cost of shearing, I fully expect to see woolless breeds of sheep, that already exist, becoming the norm on most farms. Roll
on the day!

July 5th
Hot Air of Doom Mongers
It was all hot air and water under the bridge, that little humpbacked bridge
over the river Taw that welcomes you to North Wyke. The event was the
Open Day celebrating the 25 years that IGER, the Institute of Grassland and
Environmental Research, has been at what must be one of the oldest and most
beautiful farms in Devon.
Over those years, I have tried to grab every opportunity of visiting North
Wyke and always thoroughly enjoyed each occasion. This was no exception.
If I hadn’t been lucky enough to start farming on my own account when my
student days ended, and been forced to get a job with Maff or in agricultural
research, as I had fully expected to do, I can think of no better place to have
ended up. Mind you, if it had come to that, I would by now have been retired
for over ten years, and probably dead from boredom.
For me, the most interesting research of this recent visit to North Wyke
concerned the loss of plant nutrients, especially to air and water. It’s usually
called pollution, but now that we are farming organically, it is an unacceptable
waste of potential fertilizer that we can no longer replace out of a bag. Farmers
have been conscious of the problems associated with nitrogen leaching for many
years, but the loss of phosphorus to waterways is now being tackled by IGER,
particularly as it affects the management of our grassland.
It was the figures for air pollution, however, that really bothered me. To
quote from IGER’s tour guide: “Agriculture contributes 80%, 40% and more
than 60% of the total UK emissions of ammonia, methane and nitrous oxide,
respectively. Both methane and nitrous oxide are more potent in their effect
on global warming than carbon dioxide”. Jim has already started composting
the FYM from our cattle sheds, which is the recognised best practice in organic
farming, but it appears that the ammonia released by inverting a heap of rotting
dung may be as damaging to air quality as the nitrates from careless slurry
spreading are to water quality. It seems you just can’t win, and the gas police
are just around the corner. We obviously need IGER’s research facility at North
Wyke now even more than we have in the past.
What these figures about air pollution from agriculture do not tell us is the
actual proportion that farming contributes towards global warming compared,
338

Jul 12th

Porcine Foresters

for instance, with the burning of fossil fuels. Farmers have been producing
these apparently dangerous gasses since long before the industrial revolution.
Gently steaming heaps of manure dotted around our fields was probably a sight
that greeted the Romans, and, to put it delicately, I thought methane was an
inevitable by-product of the digestive process of all animals, not just cows. No
one can surely suggest that these natural functions are seriously threatening
the planet. We seem to thrive on predictions of impending doom, and swallow
the accompanying statistics without question.
Unsubstantiated statistics are also being used to impose weird and wonderful
schemes on unenthusiastic communities as solutions to global warming. The
latest proposal that is casting a shadow over our part of North Devon is a plan
to build four gigantic wind turbines, the carrot being the potential capacity
to generate enough electricity for nearly 7,000 homes. So what? There are
nearly half a million homes in Devon alone. This suggests that if we all cut
our electricity use by little more than one percent, we could do without four
colossal wind turbines. Unfortunately, there is no doomsday impact with that
to make us do it.
It was a pleasure, therefore, on Sunday to see how our ancestors managed.
We went to another open day, this time at Dowrich House Gardens and Water
Mill, which is about three miles downstream from us. The Lee family have
refurbished what is thought to be one of the oldest water mills for grinding corn
in the district and were using the occasion of producing flour for the first time
in generations, to raise funds to maintain the Post Office in Sandford village.
The mill worked as well as it did when it was originally built, and could easily
be converted to producing electricity. There used to be at least a dozen mills
in the neighbourhood, each using the same water in turn, some of which rises
here on our farm. Perhaps the answers to global warming lie closer to home.

July 12th
Porcine Foresters
And there in a wood a Piggy-wig stood, with a ring at the end of his nose. Or,
in this case, unlike Edward Lear’s pig, without a ring and with seven brothers
and sisters, and no intention of obliging the Owl and the Pussycat. Jim has
just done what he usually does at this time of year; he’s bought some weaners
and released them into an area of woodland. In past years, he has made an
extensive pen with electric fencing in different places in the woods, purely as
a natural environment in which to fatten them for Christmas. I don’t know
339

2006
if foraging pigs make tasty pork, but friends and neighbours who top up their
freezers obviously think so.
This year, Jim has gone one better and is making the pigs do something
constructive while they lead this natural carefree existence. They are helping
to regenerate a small three-acre wood, which, apart from having a few trees
taken out during the war, appears to have remained largely untouched for the
past 100 years. The purists will probably say that it should be left to nature.
There could be a case for doing that if it were ten times the size, but as it
is, this small area of geriatric and stunted oak and ash, standing in thickets of
brambles, is slowly dying.
Jim manages the farm as a whole – the woods, the rough and steep land
as well as the tractor-workable acres, which is more than I ever did. He began
by coppicing some of the older woodland where that had obviously been done
in the distant past, but it proved very labour-intensive for little advantage. He
also tried thinning in places where trees, particularly ash, have been neglected,
with some success, although it is possibly too late for them to attain their full
size.
Seven years ago, he planted nearly twenty five thousand trees, mainly hardwood species, on open ground. These now need less intensive management, are
rapidly closing in on each other and becoming a wood rather than a plantation,
and will just need thinning in future. For every ten trees he originally planted,
only one or two will eventually reach maturity. This way of developing new
woodland has always seemed to me to be very costly and wasteful. In fact,
I don’t much like the sight of rows of regimented tree-guards marching across
the landscape, and wish there was a visually more attractive way of doing the
job. I am told that just walking away and letting nature take its course isn’t an
option on open ground, where the natural seed stock simply no longer exists.
Jim has now turned his attention to this three-acre plot and initially applied
for a felling licence to clear most of it and replant. However he had it in mind
this time to try natural regeneration, involving less disturbance to the existing
vegetation. Having seen how the pigs cleared undergrowth, without killing the
existing saplings, which only needed some daylight to get going, it looked like
being a better option. The Forestry Commission was very encouraging, and
came up with a management scheme and deer-fencing subsidy. They seem
interested to see how it turns out, although I understand they are already
involved in other similar projects.
I am no woodsman, but I think it’s a great idea. For a start, although Jim
spent much of the winter felling and winching out just the rubbish trees, the
original wood, as I’ve always known it, is still there. It may be much more
340

Jul 19th

Bunkum About Badgers

open, but it looks all the better for that. The fencing is complete and the pigs
have taken up residence. Three acres is a big area for eight little pigs, and
the process will possibly have to be repeated next summer. But hopefully the
pigs will do what pigs always used to do – scuffle through the woodland litter
fattening on the acorns, which look like being plentiful this year. They should
leave enough seed buried to germinate and set off the next generation of oak
and other indigenous trees, and hopefully all the other plant life that flourishes
in open woodland. That’s how all our woods were routinely renewed in the
past, and also how much of the pig farming was conducted. I hope it succeeds.
If not, Jim will be obliged to plant up where necessary to meet the Forestry
Commission’s requirements. I doubt the total number of pigs fattened will sway
their judgement.

Bunkum About Badgers
Size matters – at least it does if you’re a rat. No one will come to your aid, not
even the RSPCA. You will be accused of being dirty, destructive and disease
ridden. If you’re lucky you may get shot or gassed. You’re far more likely to
be poisoned with a product that results in a lingering death, used because it’s
supposedly safe to any predator that might get you before you snuff it. The
fact that any baby rats you were suckling will die slowly, will worry no one. Of
course if you were as big as a badger, things might be different.
The result of the Government’s recent consultation on badger culling clearly
demonstrates what a complete nonsense it is to base decisions of this nature on
public opinion. Out of 47,000 responses, 95% were opposed to a cull – therefore Animal Health Minister Ben Bradshaw can once again delay any action.
But looking at the figures closely, what has it proved? Apparently 70% were
campaign responses, from organisations like the Badger Groups, the RSPCA,
the Wildlife Trusts, the NFU and the National Beef Association. And the vast
majority only bothered to answer the first question - “Should badgers be culled
to control TB in high incidence areas”.
Now, organisations are fully entitled to issue thousands of pre-printed letters for their members to sign and forward to the relevant authority. There’s
probably a large percentage of people who will take the easy option and bung it
in the post without bothering to make sure of the facts. If an organisation is numerically big enough it will automatically achieve the desired result. Politicians
taking any notice of the outcome are in the wrong job.
341

2006
Unfortunately, the NFU and the NBA fell into the trap and encouraged
their members with a template they could use to respond to the consultation.
The result was a foregone conclusion. If every cattle farmer in the land, and
farmers are not well known for doing anything that smacks of paper work, had
obliged, we would still have been on a hiding to nothing. We ourselves, after
some thought did not respond. We belong to both organisations, and felt it
was their job to represent us. A 99% opposition to any cull of badgers might
actually have highlighted the emotional nature of the case put forward by the
non-farming organisations.
Interestingly, the more detailed responses from individuals and organisations
on both sides of the debate produced a very even result –50% against a cull,
41% for and 9% undecided. The Citizens Panels held to consider these findings
were marginally in favour of a cull. I am surprised and disappointed therefore
to see that the RSPCA, is now claiming that the battle is being won and asking
their members to redouble their efforts.
It’s not a battle, for heavens sake. It’s a decision that’s long overdue and
possibly involves killing animals that happen to be in our way. We kill rats
without a second thought – forgetting that in nature, they are part of the food
chain of larger predators. We find them intolerable because as lodgers they are
just small enough to make their permanent eviction nearly impossible. Rats
have had a very bad press, but I have friends who will vouch for them as making
delightful pets, running freely about their house and person. Admittedly these
are not the plain brown variety, coming in a range of brighter colours, but
otherwise no different.
The badger, on the other hand, is everybody’s favourite wild mammal. It’s
immaterial that most people have seen a live rat at one time or another, but
the vast majority have never been nearer a badger than the screen of their
TV set. So if we are to get another spate of letters to the press about badger
culling, could the Badger Trusts try and ensure their members get their facts
right. Farmers do not wish to slaughter every badger on sight, although there
are situations now where desperation is setting in. Badgers are not responsible
for most of the cases of TB in cattle. But they definitely do cause most of the
resurgence of TB in herds that have been cleared time and again of reactors
at great expense to taxpayers and herd owners. And please will people stop
writing that we eradicated TB years ago without killing badgers. Badgers have
always been culled in hotspots under Ministry supervision where all else failed,
and the sooner we accept that unpalatable fact the better.

Miliband Must Sort Out DEFRA

August 2nd
Miliband Must Sort Out DEFRA
The audience was swaying in time to the music, or maybe just avoiding the
raindrops that, here and there, were getting through the canvas of the tent
roof. As we all joined in the chorus of ‘Devon, Glorious Devon’, the livestock
farmers among us were smiling at the sound of steady rain, heralding the end of
the heat wave that had begun to threaten aftermath growth and the extent of
autumn grazing. We were enjoying the concert given by our very own, hugely
entertaining ‘Men of Morchard’, one of the final events of the weeklong Chulmleigh Old Fair. I gathered from Terry Pincombe, chairman of the organising
committee, that the attendance over the five days had broken all records, due
partly to the weather, but mainly I’m sure to the all the work that goes into
making this 700-yearold festival such a success.
It is said that Henry III founded the fair with a Royal Charter, presumably to
encourage the peasantry with a guarantee of protection from his own marauding
soldiers during the sale of local produce - an early political measure by central
government, if you like, to reassure the farming fraternity. I wonder what he
would have thought of the latest attempt to calm our fears about the future
intentions of today’s administration. If you’re not a member, you may not
know about it, but I was most surprised, when opening the cellophane envelope
that contained this month’s NFU journal, to find a 16-page glossy DEFRA
publication drop out with it. What’s going on? Did DEFRA pay the NFU
to circulate it to save postage, and, if so, how will it reach non-members? Or
did the NFU ask to be allowed to include it, as being so important that the
membership should be encouraged to read it? Cosying up to Government is one
thing, but getting into bed with the Ministry is quite another. As an ex NFU
County Chairman, I cringe just thinking about it.
The DEFRA booklet turns out to be the speech delivered to a conference at
this year’s Royal Show by David Milliband, Secretary of State for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs. It was very well reported and commented upon at the
time, but Mr Milliband obviously thinks it too important to be soon forgotten
and has turned it into a DEFRA publication. I therefore hastened to read it
more carefully.
The speech was entitled ‘One Planet Farming’, which apparently means ‘respecting the limits of our natural resources and nurturing them’. Peter Kendall,
the NFU President, whose comments on the speech are included in the DEFRA
booklet (which may explain its inclusion with NFU journal), has a crack at
the phrase ‘one planet farming’, inferring that it’s a typical political soundbite.
343

2006
I might remind David Milliband that farmers have had a better saying that
probably goes back to before the days of Henry III, which tells us to ‘Live as if
we’ll die tomorrow, but farm as if we’ll live for ever’.
As you would expect, the speech makes all the right noises that a new
Secretary of State would be bound to make to a farming audience, especially
after the woeful shortcomings of his predecessor. However, there is one area of
the Milliband thinking that I can’t pass without comment. He sets out all the
figures for the effect of farming on the environment, summing it up by saying
that the net environment cost of agriculture is around £400m a year.
Now, I don’t know how Mr Milliband relates monetary cost to damage to
the planet. He seems to have overlooked the fact that any form of farming is
bound to have some adverse effect on the environment – that’s what farming
means. Unless people go back to living like hunter-gatherers, we will always
take out more than we put in. Even primitive tribes in the Amazon jungle
cultivating just a few acres, have to move on every so many years when the
land is played out. If the quoted figure of £400m is correct, what an incredibly
efficient farming industry we possess. For a cost to the environment of less than
£7 per person, we are producing enough to feed a nation of 60 million people –
that is if we wasted nothing and ate a little less.
Mr Milliband has surely far more scope to tackle the environmental side of
his brief outside agriculture. He won’t be in the job more than a few years at
most, but his best legacy to farming would be to concentrate on resurrecting
DEFRA to a ministry we can all be proud of.

Excellent Flavour of Beef
I’ve gone back to eating bread and dripping. It’s delicious, but that description
may be tempered by nostalgia, since the last time I ate it regularly was at
boarding school during wartime rationing. I still look back with relish at the
thought of ‘dried-egg-fried-bread’, spam or whale meat. This sudden flashback
to the past has come about in a quite unexpected way.
For some reason, a couple of our Angus-cross heifers never got in calf last
year. Rather than put them into the over-thirty-months scheme (OTMS), Jim
decided to keep them until we could sell them for human consumption, as that
scheme was at last coming to an end. They went off for slaughter in June, having
spent a final few weeks at grass to give them a bit of finish. The younger one,
about four years old by this time, was in good nick, and fetched more than
double what we would have received under the old incineration payment. It
344

Aug 9th

Excellent Flavour of Beef

brought home to us how much OTMS has cost suckler farmers like us for the
last ten years.
The older one, which was nearer five, was obviously much too fat to make a
good price and Jim decided to have it back for the freezer. The nearest abattoir
available to take older cattle, and prepared to hang one for at least three weeks
for home consumption, was some distance, but the heifer is now back, cut up
and safely stowed away. We are, for the first time in years, enjoying the taste of
extensively reared, grass fed and ‘really’ mature beef, the beef of Old England.
The flavour is excellent, although the meat perhaps a little bit chewy. Another
week or two hanging might have been better, but finding somewhere willing to
do this would have been a problem.
As you would expect, the first joint Jenny cooked produced an inordinate
amount of surplus liquid fat in the roasting. Rather than throw it all away,
I suggested leaving it for me to eat as dripping, something I haven’t done for
years. As a result, I am tempted to give up butter altogether – but whether
that would shorten or prolong my life, I’ve no idea.
The question this immediately poses is was it really necessary to take this
animal all that way and then bring it back for our own consumption, when it
could as easily have been slaughtered here at home. I am assured that it is
perfectly legal to kill and dress a bullock on the farm, and, provided the waste
is properly bagged up and disposed, the farmer can eat it. I am also told, and
this I find very difficult to believe, that it is only the farmer that can eat it.
His family, relatives, friends or neighbours cannot, neither can he give it away
without risking prosecution. (I think I just saw a white rabbit looking at his
watch as he hurried past my window.) If that regulation is Europe-wide, I’ll
bet we’re the only nation observing it.
I have raised this point about on-farm slaughter before and I make no apology for bringing it up again. I believe there are just two mobile licensed slaughter facilities in the UK, which are hideously expensive, but it should surely not
be too difficult to set up local processing plants, to which newly killed animals
could be quickly transferred, to be inspected and dealt with. It would help if we
didn’t have such a negligible number of small local slaughterhouses remaining
today compared with the rest of Europe. Is it another example of a different
Ministry interpretation of the rules governing their operation?
I have another reason for wishing we could advance to slaughtering animals
for sale on farm. There was an item on BBC’s Countryfile the other week,
comparing the taste of Kobe beef, produced from Japanese Wagyu cattle, with
our own home produced article. You may have seen it. The Kobe beef won
a blind taste-test hands down. I know Wagyu cattle are apparently raised on
345

2006
a diet that includes beer and are routinely massaged with sake, but the point
that interested me, and which I am sure makes the real difference, is that the
animals have to be slaughtered with extreme care on farm. This reduces to
a minimum the stress induced hormone surge which is known to make a huge
difference to the taste of the flesh. If that fact alone persuades us to give our
farm animals a better end, it will be worth doing.

August 16th
Old Boy Auger Problem
That’s last year done with and we can now start thinking about the year ahead.
To an outsider, this may seem an odd way of viewing the middle of August,
but although the seasons inevitably run into one another on a farm, the finish
of the corn harvest has always, since farming began, been the pivotal time in
the farming calendar.
In our case, with only one 16-acre field of triticale to get in and the weather
about as dry as it could be, harvesting should have been a doddle. As it was I
managed to show my age when doing the simple job of keeping an eye on the
propionic acid applicator as the corn was elevated into the silo: I allowed the
auger to jam between loads. Result – four loads of corn had to be tipped onto
an area of clean concrete, which Jim with commendable foresight had prepared
before the combine arrived, while we shovelled a ton or so of corn out of the
auger pit to see what the problem was. If you’ve ever had to do that in a hurry,
you’ll know why I was not exactly flavour of the day.
This is the first year that the arable ground has not had a nitrogen top
dressing in the early spring. Previously a couple of hundredweight of nitrochalk spread on every acre, arable and grass alike, ensured a good early growth
in case we had a dry year. Farming organically this year, Jim applied a light
dressing of very well-rotted dung to all the grass ground in March, but hesitated
at the triticale, in case with a wet summer we ended up with flat corn at harvest
time. There was no question of that, but the yield was substantially down, little
more than half our normal. Fortunately we have a good carry over of corn from
last year, which should see us through the winter. The last thing we want to
do is start buying expensive organic concentrates.
This reduction in corn yield does highlight the increased cost of going organic. In the case of hay and silage making where the bill from the contractor
is based on the number of bales tied and wrapped, the expense relates directly
to the tonnage of fodder conserved, whether it is organic or non-organic. Obviously we have to mow and turn more acres if the crop is not so heavy, but we
346

Aug 23rd

Road Safety Matters

do that ourselves and possibly do it quicker. The cost of combining corn, on
the other hand, has always been based on acreage. Which means that half the
normal yield represents double the cost per ton – not so clever since combining
is by far the biggest expense of corn growing for the smaller farmer relying on
contractors.
Although Jim dunged the arable ground at the normal rate last autumn
before drilling, he has already this summer cleared all the cattle yards and
heaped the resulting FYM beside next season’s corn ground to complete the
composting process, something we haven’t done in the past. It looks as if most,
if not all of it will end up being ploughed in - the grass ground having to manage
without any next spring.
There was another unforeseen aspect of going organic. We have always
avoided spraying if possible anyway, but the smothering effect of a dense early
growth of plant material, boosted by the nitro-chalk, which was normally our
best way of controlling arable weeds, was absent this year. It may be because
of the hot weather, but it is a long time since I’ve seen such a crop of thistles
as we have in the straw. At least it came in in big bales, untouched by hand,
but thank goodness we were not harvesting with a binder, and having to shock
up the resulting sheaves – even with a long sleeved shirt, the forearms used to
end up red-raw.
Come to that, thank goodness the harvest this year took only a couple of
days, instead of the two or three weeks of years gone by, with trailer-loading,
rick building, thatching and eventual threshing sometime in the winter, yet to
come. Still, there was a plus side that’s worth remembering - the corn and
straw eventually came out smelling far sweeter from a rick than any method of
storage we use now. And old boys like me didn’t have to worry about bringing
harvesting to a halt by overloading a corn auger.

August 23rd
Road Safety Matters
This must never happen again - the words of the coroner at the inquest into the
world’s first road traffic death involving a car in 1896. Today, 110 years later,
we manage to kill in road accidents over three thousand people every year in
Britain alone and more than a million people a year worldwide.
These frightening statistics are almost tolerated as the price we pay for the
freedom of movement afforded us by the motorcar. I say ‘almost’ because we
constantly tinker about with remedies which are hoped will reduce this carnage.
The latest is a suggestion that the speed limit on all rural roads should be
347

2006
lowered to 40mph, following the announcement that nearly two thirds of all
road deaths occur in rural areas.
But are speed limits really the answer? That first fatality was caused by a
car travelling at what was described at the time as ‘tremendous speed’. It was
actually going at four miles an hour and managed to run over a forty four year
old mother of two, with the driver apparently chatting up his lady passenger at
the time of the accident. That sums up very neatly what has been happening
ever since – nobody was paying enough attention to the road.
I am not suggesting for one moment that we should attempt to drive fast on
some of our narrower lanes, but there are many stretches of country road that
are straight enough and wide enough and occasionally empty enough to reach 50
or even 60mph. The frustration of having drive slowly in these circumstances,
possibly after being stuck for miles behind an oversized lorry would probably
only increase the likelihood of a fatal crash occurring round the next bend.
We forget that travelling and accidents have always gone together. I have a
couple of ancestors who fell off horses - one was killed and the other seriously
injured – while going about their business. And that’s all our rural roads were
designed for – to get to work, to deliver goods and serve agriculture. Nowadays
we have more people than ever living in the countryside. Many go to work
every day, not just locally, but commuting to some distant town. Add to them
the numerous tourists and sightseeing pensioners who now drive cars instead of
sitting out their retirement. I wonder how many deaths there are relative to the
number of miles travelled per head of the population. On that basis, I wouldn’t
be at all surprised if today’s roads are actually safer than ever they were.
That isn’t to say there’s nothing we can do to improve matters. I won’t
dwell on the newcomers who fail to realise that blind corners on our minor
roads are rarely wide enough for two cars to pass at speed, or that, if wing
mirrors are to be preserved where it is possible to pass, both cars need to have
inside wheels tight to the verge and hang the paintwork. And I’ll certainly
refrain from pointing out to my fellow oldies that it’s extraordinary a doctor’s
certificate isn’t yet required to renew a driving licence.
I will turn instead to my own profession, where the free use of country
roads is vital to our work. We have all come up at one time or another behind
an enormous farm trailer, knowing that the invisible tractor driver in front
is unaware of our increasingly frustrated presence. However that is nothing
compared to meeting one of these combinations advancing at speed downhill in
a narrow lane, apparently unable to hold back a fully laden trailer.
It happened to Jenny a few years ago, and although she had engaged reverse
gear when the collision occurred, our car was a total write off and she was lucky
348

Aug 30th

Plenty to Beef About

to be alive. Exactly the same thing happened to a friend in another parish,
and again the front of his car was crushed, he and his passenger also escaping
unharmed. It is a fatality waiting to happen, if it hasn’t already. What worries
me is that in both cases, the driver at the wheel of the tractor was a youth, fully
qualified to drive a tractor on the road, but without a licence to handle what
is effectively a heavy goods vehicle. I have no doubt that saying this will make
me unpopular with some of my friends, but if this isn’t addressed, we may all
find ourselves restricted in the use of what we see as our own lanes.

August 30th
Plenty to Beef About
It hardly seems like two years since that inaugural Beef & Growing Cattle South
West event took place at Hatherleigh Market. It was heralded at the time as
an opportunity to put behind us the horrors of the foot and mouth epidemic
that devastated Devon in 2001. And yet, what changes have occurred on the
farming scene since then. The dreadful Secretary of State who plagued us for
so long has at last been dispatched overseas, and we have a new young spark
in the driving seat. If his blog is anything to go by, he has much to learn, but
time will tell whether he’s firing on all the right cylinders. And after the last
two years, he certainly better be.
Two years ago, we were receiving cash from the taxpayer for every beef
cow we kept on the farm and every steer we sold to the butcher. The shopper
was buying cheap steaks, and nobody seemed very bothered about where they
came from. If they came from British farms, well, weren’t we getting brown
envelopes regularly to make up for all the welfare and environmental rules we
had to conform to? If instead the steaks came from Brazil, no problem. The
possibility of re-importing foot and mouth disease had been taken care of, with
six specially trained sniffer dogs to cover all our airports. And cutting down
the rain forests – why, even the experts seemed in two minds about whether we
really were seeing the beginning of climate change.
In two short years, all that has altered. Or nearly all. We’re no longer
getting any financial support for producing beef. And we’re certainly not getting
a succession of payments to keep our cash flows ticking over. We are being paid
instead to keep the countryside looking exactly as if we are producing beef and milk and corn and all the other things farmers have always produced. That
is if we’re fortunate enough to be in DEFRA’s good books. If our details have
been lost in their computers, a not uncommon occurrence these days, some of
us will be lucky if we’re paid next year for last year’s work.
349

2006
What work you ask, if you’re not a farmer. Keeping the countryside looking
as if we’re farming it, without producing anything, sounds pretty simple. Of
course there are hedges to be maintained, fields to be kept from becoming
overgrown, DEFRA booklets to be carefully read and forms to be filled, and
unavoidably, inspectors to be greeted with a tug of the forelock, when conducted
round the ancestral acres.
But, to the great majority of us, such hard work would be anathema. Far
better to at least keep cattle and sheep maintaining the land in farming condition. In fact, it is increasingly evident that in some areas of the uplands,
livestock are essential to fulfil that function. So I shall be heading to Beef
South West next week at Hatherleigh to discover how much progress there has
been since the 2004 event in the development of the new composite 4-way cross
Stabiliser breed and Bill Harper’s Improved Suckler Half-breds, both of which
featured then.
There are glimmers on the horizon that the future for beef producers may
be getting rosier. We are exporting to Europe again, mature beef is being eaten
at long last instead of being incinerated, there is an over all shortage of beef
in the EU, and we are beginning to actually experience global warming, which
makes it easier to dissuade people from shopping around the world for cheap
food. The National Beef Association (NBA) has even succeeded in ensuring
that in future retailers clearly separate beef from different countries of origin in
their display cabinets.
However one vital thing hasn’t yet changed. Two years ago at this time, beef
was making about 190pp Kg. Today, beef is still making little more than 190pp
Kg. For many of us, beef production at that price is barely sustainable. If we
are to continue rearing beef cattle in sufficient numbers until prices really pick
up, to keep the industry alive here in the region we need all the encouragement
we can get. Congratulations therefore to the NBA Southwest for putting on the
Beef event once again. An enormous amount of work goes into staging such a
show but I’m sure it will be every bit as successful as last time.

The Age of Kale Recalled

September 6th
The Age of Kale Recalled
Of all the crops that we’ve grown on this farm over the years, there was one that
made more difference to the fertility of our soil than all the others put together.
It also probably earned us more money than any other crop in the early days.
Older dairy farmers will immediately twig that I’m referring to ‘kale’, which we
grew as a winter-feed for our milking cows. As a crop it has now been almost
completely superseded by maize and grass silage.
In my first years here, one of the daily chores after morning milking from
October onwards was cutting a load of marrow-stem kale. The plants were five
or six feet tall with stems as thick as your wrist, and were cut by hand with a
machete. This was then hauled back to the cowshed, and unloaded in armfuls
for the cows, which were always chained up in those days for the duration of
the winter. As you can imagine, after cleaning out the cow-standings with a
wheelbarrow, hand-feeding kale was a job I could have well done without. In
frosty weather, the machete had a nasty habit of bouncing off the kale-stalk and
ending up in the hand grasping the plant – I still have the scars to show for it.
Kale was a vital part of the winter ration then for dairy cows, particularly
in our case. We had a premium contract with our local milk factory, which
augmented the fresh milk supplies to London during the winter months. Our
contract, therefore, was weighted heavily in favour of winter milk production,
which we met by autumn calving. A fresh green crop, to get the cows milking
well in early lactation, was essential in the days before silage making.
In 1953, some bright farmer came up with the idea of allowing cows to graze
kale by reaching for it under a carefully aligned electric fence, which prevented
the crop from being trampled. The cows very quickly caught on to this way of
feeding, the brighter ones even kneeling on the ground to reach further into the
crop than their fellows. Dairy farmers also very quickly caught on, and most of
us were strip-grazing kale by the following winter.
This meant we could grow kale varieties that would stand frost better than
the old marrow-stem, which had been easier to cut and cart. We could also
get away from driving tractors in and out of fields on a daily basis, which in
wet winters resulted in axle-deep wheel-ruts that were the devil to get rid of.
Setting the electric fence every morning was a doddle compared to kale cutting,
but probably the biggest gain was allowing the cows out to get fresh air and
exercise every day instead of being tied up for months on end.
Of course, there was a down side, the most obvious being the mud that
accompanied the cows as they returned for evening milking. In exceptionally
351

2006
wet years, the kale field could end up looking like the Somme, with cows wading
about up to their udders, and mud starting to flow out of the gateways. We
put up with it for the benefits, particularly those of us on thin soils. It was
easy to grow, it fitted in well with rotational farming, and raised the fertility of
the ground for subsequent crops. When I started farming here, our topsoil was
extremely shallow – three or four inches overlying a soft shale. By the time we
had grown kale and poached every field in turn over a twenty-year period, we
had turned shale into topsoil, which more than doubled its depth.
I recount all this because I have recently completed our ‘Cross Compliance
Soil Protection Review’. This latest bit of form filling is about thirty pages
long, but is actually the easiest to complete that I can remember. Patronising
isn’t too strong a word to use about it. It treats us as a bunch of idiots,
which I’m beginning to think we must be to tolerate this nonsense. We do
not even return the booklet, but retain it for some inspector to check when
a thunderstorm washes mud into the road. The question that really grabbed
me queried whether we damaged our soil structure by poaching. The answers
suggested we should remove stock when poaching started, or select sites for
out-wintering carefully. Thank goodness I didn’t have to worry about this fifty
years ago. Our topsoil would still be only a few inches deep.

September 13th
Tory’s Badger Blues
I frequently hear the comment these days from my fellow farmers that things
are bound to get better when the other lot get in. It’s not just a politically
motivated remark, although it’s probably true to say that most farmers tend
to vote ‘Tory’. I think all of us are fed up with the way this administration is
handling agriculture and would welcome a change.
Conservatives may well win the next election, but not because they have
been a tower of strength in opposition, they haven’t – they’ve been pathetic.
In fact, I blame many of the ills that DEFRA have visited on us in recent years
on the weakness with which opposition spokesmen have dealt with Agriculture
Ministers in Parliament. They’ve had numerous opportunities to really savage
New Labour’s method of introducing the Single Farm Payment Scheme and of
eradicating Bovine TB, the two most contentious concerns in farming today.
Neither the Conservatives, nor the Liberal Democrats for that matter, have
made any discernable impact on either problem.
It is too late to alter the SFP scheme, although the transition to whatever, if
anything, replaces it, will be the responsibility of the next government. Dealing
352

Sep 13th

Tory’s Badger Blues

with TB, however, is here and now, and something which is drummed home
to me on an almost daily basis. Every time I meet a farming acquaintance,
I hear the latest version of how TB is affecting them – either on a farm with
animals reacting for the first time ever, as happened to us last year, or a renewed
outbreak in herds that seemed to have gone clear, or, worst of all, where farmers
who are currently battling with TB, are having cattle go down with lesions to
confirm the disease, in animals which tested negative two months previously.
That is why I made sure I attended the discussion forum on “Solutions
to Bovine TB” at the Beef and Growing Cattle event last week. Dr John
Gallagher, the ex-ministry vet with vast experience in eradicating the disease
in the past, was scathing in his criticism of today’s attempts, as was Bryan Hill,
a Devon farmer who has made a detailed study of TB in badgers on his own
farm. Both papers deserve a much wider audience, preferably accompanied by
a contribution from a senior member of DEFRA’s State Veterinary Service and
also from a leading representative of the Badger Protection Societies.
However, what I was most anxious to hear were the views of James Paice
MP, the Conservative shadow agriculture minister, who gave the first paper. I
can think of no one in a stronger position to persuade this Government to act.
Yet he seemed to be suggesting that it is we farmers who should be redoubling
our efforts to change public opinion on the need to eliminate the disease in our
wildlife. I am not even sure Mr Paice was fully aware of the latest proposals that
farming organisations have recently put to DEFRA, but he had left the forum
before the other speakers got started. I came away with the uncomfortable
feeling that if he were in charge, nothing would be different.
I should have liked to quiz Mr Paice on his understanding of a government’s
responsibilities regarding notifiable diseases, of which TB is one. The Diseases of
Animals Acts have existed for over a hundred years, the one relating specifically
to TB in cattle since 1937, when the Ministry were given authority by parliament
to spend money in stamping out TB and in establishing the state veterinary
service. This must, through advisers, devise and enforce measures to control
contagious diseases. As a farming industry we can give our view of the measures
necessary, just as any other group or organisation is entitled to do. But it’s not
our job to convince public opinion that something like a badger-cull is necessary.
It’s for Government to make that decision, and if it feels so insecure over public
reaction, it is for Government to do the convincing. It certainly didn’t hold
back over foot and mouth in ordering the contiguous cull, when an opportune
date for the general election was at risk.
If Mr Paice wants to convince me that he will make a good agriculture
minister, he could begin by doing a better job of highlighting to the public in

detail just how disastrously the scourge of TB is currently being tackled, and
where he would act differently. Had he stayed to hear Dr Gallagher, he would
be aware that cases have now been confirmed in cats and a dog.

Fun Way to Pick Apples
Whenever there’s a glut of apples in our orchard as there is this autumn, I
can’t help but recall finding myself perched at the top of a thirty foot ladder,
teetering precariously against a very tall apple tree and picking apples on a warm
September day sixty years ago. I suffer from vertigo and climbing high ladders
is something I avoid, but my Uncle Arthur would have none of it. “There’s
nothing to it, boy. Don’t bother about resting the ladder on a branch, just put
it up against the outside of the tree and let it fall inwards as you reach for the
apples. Then do it again from a different angle until you’ve cleared them all.
You can’t fall off – it’s as safe as houses.” Today’s ‘Health and Safety’ brigade
would just love it.
I was a teenager on my uncle’s farm in West Sussex during the long summer
holiday, the last one I was to enjoy before my final year at school. Apples were
not plentiful that year thanks to some very frosty weather in May, but here and
there a few places seemed to have escaped the worst of it. My uncle had three
or four very old orchards that normally yielded less than average crops, but this
once they were loaded. I don’t think Uncle Arthur bothered too much about
apples – he was a dairy farmer – but in view of the general shortage nationally,
he must have decided to do a proper job that year and pick the various varieties
as they became ripe and store them to sell through the winter months.
So it was that I arrived for a leisurely two weeks to find my cousins and
the farm staff and anyone else nimble enough to scramble up a ladder, pressed
into action. And vertigo or no, up I had to go. Actually it was easier than I
expected once I forgot the height and concentrated on getting the apples into
my shoulder bag as gently as possible. There was plenty of help moving the
wooden ladders, which were awkward and heavy, and splayed widely at the
bottom rungs to prevent them toppling sideways. The apples were carted away
and stored in long straw covered clamps in every available farm building.
I’ve no doubt apple harvesting has come a long way since then, with modern
trees less than half the height and ladders superseded by what are known as
‘cherry pickers’. But it can’t be anything like as much fun now as it was to a
schoolboy in the days when all harvesting was a kind of hard working communal
celebration. I went back to the farm a year later to await my National Service
354

medical. The old apple trees had gone, pulled up and piled onto bonfires, that
last bumper crop the end of them. The orchards were bare fields with pigs
everywhere rooting through the soil to prepare the ground for ploughing. The
final harvest had produced enough apples to send a fully laden lorry up to
Borough ‘fruit and vegetable’ Market in London every week until the following
spring.
Uncle Arthur was a most unusual man and one of the most well-read I’ve
known. He began life in the Royal Navy as an anchor boy on a battleship in the
14/18 war, with the job of jumping onto a seaweed-slippery iron buoy when the
ship reached port, to begin the process of attaching the mooring chain. He went
on to serve as a submariner. After the war, he turned to farming. His wedding
to my Aunt Esme was sufficiently out of the ordinary to make news in the local
papers. My grandfather wouldn’t agree to his daughter marrying a farmer –
understandably, seeing the way agriculture was going in the mid twenties. The
ceremony took place at Ditchling near the South Downs and is best described
by a chance bystander. Apparently, early one misty morning, a rider appeared
from over the hill, dismounted, tied up his horse to the gate and went into the
parish church. A little later, a lady appeared also on horseback from a different
direction, dismounted, tied up her horse and entered the church. After a while
they came out of the church together, still in their riding gear, accompanied
only by two witnesses. They mounted up and departed, but separately, each
returning in the direction from which they’d come. How’s that for eloping in
style!

September 27th
What Is DEFRA Planning?
We all knew that cattle, sheep and pigs, which were not suffering from foot and
mouth disease, were being slaughtered during that terrible summer of 2001. A
desperate situation needed desperate remedies. It should come as no surprise,
therefore, to anyone involved in livestock farming to be told now by researchers
from the Institute of Animal Health, that more than a million farm animals
were culled needlessly in the battle to bring the disease under control.
I won’t go over old ground as to why the situation had become so desperate.
Lax veterinary inspections of a swill-feeding pig farm almost certainly initiated
the outbreak, with a two or three week’s delay before the disease was reported,
allowing the virus to spread widely through sheep in the area. A similar chain
of events can easily happen again, and probably will. What is surprising is
355

2006
that DEFRA hasn’t seized this opportunity to explain to us what measures are
being developed to overcome an outbreak next time it occurs.
The research report does point out the difficulty of on-farm diagnosis of the
disease in sheep, which unlike pigs or cattle, show few clinical signs. In order
to slaughter within 24 hours, animals were being killed before the results of
samples taken to be tested at a lab could be known. It suggests that this was
the main reason why many of the 24 per cent of all farms thought to be infected,
were in fact disease free.
It is unthinkable that such wholesale slaughter, with a contiguous cull thrown
in to create disease-free zones, can ever be justified in the future. Obviously,
there are two areas that have to be addressed to ensure it never happens. Firstly,
a test for immediate confirmation by a vet of the presence of the foot and mouth
virus is essential. I understand that a ‘penside’ test, as it’s called, using a
disposable device giving immediate results similar to a home pregnancy kit, is
currently undergoing trials. The research is being funded by DEFRA and the
EU and, if successful, would not only ensure that just those farms where the
disease was present were targeted, but also might eventually make it possible
to cull on a farm only those animals that were together in a group.
However the other change to the present eradication measures that really
must be introduced is the use of vaccination. By that I mean vaccination-tolive, which was never on the cards five years ago. There was talk about it at
the time, and a lot of bad publicity about the apparent reluctance of farmers
to embrace the idea. But all that was being proposed then was its use as a
holding mechanism, allowing for the slaughter of vaccinated animals at a later
date. Nor was there any assurance from the supermarkets that they would be
prepared to sell meat and milk from these unfortunate animals while they were
awaiting their eventual fate. To ask farmers to continue milking and fattening
them indefinitely to no good purpose was surely expecting too much.
There were other problems attached to vaccination. With the disease raging
unconfined, there was no way of differentiating between the antibodies of a
diseased animal and a vaccinated animal, nor was it possible to be sure that
animals were not already incubating foot and mouth at the time of vaccination.
Thankfully these difficulties seem to have been overcome. Marker vaccines
have been developed which allow for tests to confirm subsequently that animals
are disease-free. And an antiviral serum is now available that will give shortterm protection until vaccination takes effect. The picture for ‘vaccinate-to-live’
begins to look altogether brighter.
However, if, as I suspect, DEFRA has already taken steps to allow for an
immediate vaccination programme in the event of another foot and mouth out356

Oct 4th

On Going Dairy Problems

break, it is surely essential that people are told sooner rather than later about
the safety of meat and milk products from vaccinated animals being allowed into
the normal human food chain. Farm livestock have been protected in this way
from life-threatening diseases all the years I’ve been farming, without causing
anyone the least concern. It would be somewhat ironic if the descendants of the
cow which provided Dr Jenner with the vaccine to demonstrate how diseases
like smallpox could be effectively prevented, should now be denied the possibility of having their own lives prolonged because government failed to keep the
public fully informed.

October 4th
On Going Dairy Problems
Rural Affairs Minister Barry Gardner seems to have got milk producers in a
right old lather over remarks he made at the Labour Party Conference, when he
suggested that Britain’s dairy industry needed a “hell of a shake-out”. Frankly,
I’m surprised that farmers expected him to say anything different. I know very
little about him, except that he’s an urban MP with no farmers in his constituency and new to his appointment at DEFRA. I’ve no doubt that virtually
every one of his townie constituents would agree with his remarks wholeheartedly. And, actually, if he’d used the words “hell of a shake-up”, so would I.
I am normally very careful about commenting on farming problems of which
I don’t have first hand knowledge, but having been a dairy farmer for over thirty
years and still being closely involved with a milk producer cooperative, I shall
overcome my usual reticence. I would like to know what the farmers attending
the meeting at which Barry Gardner made his remarks expected him to say.
He was asked to comment on the fact that milk prices have remained below
the cost of production for several years. He not unnaturally pointed out the
23 per cent difference in profitability between the best performing and worst
performing farmers, figures which I’ve no doubt his staff had provided him with
against such a question.
If he remains in his job long enough, he will come to realise that all farm
production tends to have a wide variation in efficiency - that is the diverse
nature of the industry. It’s as diverse as the landscape, the weather conditions,
soil types, farm size and even farmers themselves. However, in advising the least
profitable among us to pack in milk production, he did inadvertently touch on
what I believe is the crux of the matter when he said that the problem did not
lie with the supermarkets and processors “who set the price”.
357

2006
I find it quite extraordinary that there are thirty-eight farm-gate prices for
August milk, nearly all different, quoted in the “Farmers Weekly” milk price
review. They vary between 21.58 ppl (pence per standard litre) and 15.95 ppl.
– that’s a difference of 26 per cent between the highest and lowest price, even
greater than Barry Gardner’s difference in profitability. And those prices are
for exactly the same product - milk, of exactly the same quality. And only the
highest price is anywhere near the figure that milk should be making today.
So what should we do about it? Currently, there seems to be strong support
for the idea of invoicing buyers for the extra production costs of high energy and
drought conditions that dairy farming has had to meet this year, but I can’t
for the life of me believe that the processors will tamely pay up and pass the
bill up the line. It might gain some sympathy from the public, but everyone is
suffering from drought and high fuel bills. It certainly won’t induce government
to step in and force the supermarkets to pass an increase of that order back to
producers. Why should it, when there are so many processing companies eager
to undercut each other to stay in business? And long term it won’t solve the
real problem – thirty-eight different contract prices for one basic farm product,
standard raw milk, which is unique in that it cannot be stored on farm for more
than a day or two. Which leads me to the obvious conclusion that the fewer
milk processors there are, the better the price is likely to be.
I am not dreaming of the resurrection of a statutory Milk Marketing Board,
much as I like the idea of one national milk-producer cooperative. There are
plenty of producers today doing their own marketing and making a great success
of it, something that was difficult under MMB regulations. Nor do I believe
dairy farmers are yet desperate enough to collaborate to that extent voluntarily.
But surely there must be a case for three, at most, regional cooperatives –
businesses that would not be forever trying to carve each other up. This would
allow us to set the price, and allow us to prevent the supermarkets effectively
branding their milk as own label, when what is actually in their cartons is milk
at the lowest price to which they can screw their suppliers.

Farming Insects and Birds

October 11th
Farming Insects and Birds
Thank goodness for the recent spell of wet weather. For all the talk of global
warming, this year’s weather conditions have suited us very well, until, that
is, the hot dry spell in late August and early September started turning our
pastures yellow. It began to look as if the abundance of hay and red clover
silage Jim had harvested this summer might be needed before the clocks went
back, an ominous sign for any hope of getting through the winter with fodder
to spare.
With the rain all that has changed; the ground is still warm enough for the
grass to start growing again and firm enough to keep the cattle outside, without
poaching, for a good while yet. They are at present grazing the red clover leys,
which are in full flower – an ideal food plant for the unusual number of cloudedyellow butterflies around this autumn. Now that we are well into our second
year of organic farming, I am consciously watching for any signs of increased
biodiversity on the farm, something often claimed by the organic lobby.
Although we have included some red clover in our grass leys in the past,
using it as the main ingredient of the seeds mixture is regarded as the organic
method of providing sufficient natural nitrogen to get good crops of hay or
silage in hot dry summers. It has certainly worked for us this year, with two
cuts safely harvested and a third cut possible if we had needed it. Instead, Jim
is letting the cattle graze it off while the ground conditions allow.
Is it possible that by grazing a bulky clover crop in this way, there may be
sufficient plant material left for any clouded-yellow caterpillars, which will also
be feeding on the red clover at this time of year, to survive through the winter?
It will need a warm winter for that to happen, but perhaps climate change will
work to this species’ advantage, and the clouded-yellow will become a resident
butterfly, instead of an irregular immigrant. What I like about the possibility is
that it will have happened, not because we are growing red clover just to attract
clouded-yellows, but because it is the economic way for us to farm – that is if
we continue to farm organically.
Here is where I fall out with those well-intentioned people who are trying to
save or even introduce wildlife species that are disappearing from our farmland
because farming methods have moved on, as they inevitably do. I like the
sound of a corncrake as much as the next man, or rather as little as the next
man when they keep me awake most of the night, as happened when we were
on holiday a few years ago. Corncrakes are apparently making a comeback in
the Highland and Islands, but their progress is dependant on extensive cattle
359

2006
rearing. For which reason, there is a campaign to “develop funding mechanisms
to help retain and expand these farming systems”. Not to produce more beef,
you will notice, which is why the corncrakes where there when the systems were
viable, but just to produce more corncrakes.
To come much nearer home, I am even more uneasy by the recent announcement that cirl buntings are to be reintroduced into Cornwall. According to the
RSPB they are “stunning birds to look at but are rather lazy, never moving
more than a mile from their birthplace”. They have apparently disappeared
from Cornwall because of changes in farming practices, which implies they were
dependant on an outdated habitat. I find it difficult to visualise a less ‘stunning’ little bird, and if they cannot be bothered to look for alternative places
to live, they are going to need help permanently to keep them going. So what
exactly is the point in bringing them back? When I have asked the RSPB, I
have been told they act as an indicator species, their presence showing that we
are managing the environment benignly.
Recreating bygone and artificial farming landscapes is hardly an indication
of benign management, but if charitable organisations wish to spend their members’ money paying farmers to do so, who am I to grumble. My unease stems
from the reported involvement of Natural England in the project. This is the
newly created government body that has taken over responsibility for the Organic Entry Scheme, which we are signed up to. Will their inspectors be viewing
our farm as possible cirl bunting habitat?

October 18th
New Rule Would Finish Us
I have only just become aware of an extraordinary directive that has emerged
from Brussels, which if implemented, could spell the end of cattle farming for the
foreseeable future in this part of Devon. Of course I am exaggerating – or am I? I
am referring to the draft proposal that would severely restrict the compensation
paid to farmers for the compulsory slaughter of their animals in controlling
notifiable diseases. With outbreaks of diseases like foot and mouth, swine fever
or fowl pest, which are not normally endemic and have to be introduced from
abroad, an individual farm should, at worst, only expect to be hit once in a
generation. That doesn’t make it any easier for the farmer to accept if he has
been wiped out for the greater good, and finds himself in financial straits when
restocking after the disease has run its course.
However, it’s not the level of compensation set by the directive that is so
alarming, it is the restriction on which farms will be entitled to any compen360

Oct 18th

New Rule Would Finish Us

sation at all. To put it simply, very large farming businesses will not receive
a penny, and the rest of us will only be compensated, at the reduce rate, if
we lose more than 30 per cent of our animals. Which of course means that in
attempting to eradicate a disease like bovine TB, most of us will get nothing at
all.
With regular TB testing, I would be surprised if 30 per cent of a herd has
ever reacted at one test. Even if the proposal allows for the number of animals
slaughtered as reactors to be accumulated until the herd goes clear, more than
30 per cent must be unusual. And what about cows that are slaughtered and,
on post mortem, found to have no evidence of infection? The TB test is not
infallible. Are we to be denied compensation for an animal that is taken out on
the precautionary principle, which is how the system operates at present?
That was the case with the two in-calf heifers we lost 18 months ago. They
were valued at a fair price had we wished to sell them, but they could not
have been replaced from a reputable breeder for that money. We have been
clear since then and our next herd test is due in March. If we are unfortunate
enough to have another reactor, any compensation we might receive has already
been halved, since the valuation table that is currently used takes no account
of the organic status of the animal. If the European Commission has its way,
and the new directive is introduced on January 1 as announced, we shall get
precisely nothing, presumably even if the animal turns out to be disease free.
The whole thing seemed so bizarre that I took the trouble to speak to Kevin
Pearce, the NFU’s head of food and farming, to see if I had understood it
correctly. He did not hold back in his opinion of the Directorate-General for
Agriculture for dreaming up such complete nonsense. All the UK farming organisations and DEFRA had been fiercely opposed to the proposal through a
very short consultation period, and virtually every European country was also
totally against acceptance. Mr Pearce saw no possibility of the directive being
implemented. The legal implications alone hardly bear thinking about – the
lawyers would have a field day.
Which is all very reassuring, but I am reminded of the introduction of milk
quotas nearly 23 years ago. It couldn’t be done, it was much too complicated,
it would take too long to get agreement - and so on. In the event, quotas were
introduced almost overnight, and for the same reason that is driving the present
proposal – finance, or rather lack of it. So I have to believe that, at best, this
is a Commission ploy to get us to swallow a watered-down version that may
appear almost open-handed by comparison.
Unfortunately, with TB virtually out of control here in the southwest, any
further reduction at all in compensation rates could well be the last straw for
361

2006
many of us. I had hoped that, with our own government making no real effort
to get a grip on the situation, the bureaucrats in Brussels might by now have
made themselves popular for a change and overridden DEFRA’s continual shillyshallying. Pigs might fly.

October 25th
Calving Amid the Thunder
I tipped the water out of my boots and left them upturned to drain. It was
midnight and the storm had gone. Even with a waterproof on, I was soaked to
the skin, but at least it was a warm night. I had been giving Jim and Bev a
hand calving a cow.
The autumn calving cows are grazing pastures near the farm buildings, which
makes it easier to get them in if there is trouble. Jim had noticed one looking
pensive earlier in the evening, and although we prefer to let them calve outside,
by half ten, he decided to bring her in. I saw the torches waving about in the
field and, putting on a mac in the light rain and with an occasional lightening
flash on the horizon, I went down to help.
The cow was naturally reluctant to leave her companions, and we were
obliged to gather them all up together when the heavens suddenly opened. I
can’t recall being out among a bunch of cattle during such a violent overhead
thunderstorm. The cows seemed surprisingly unconcerned at the crack of lightning strikes all round us, the grass and trees a vivid green against the blackness
of the sky, with the almost simultaneous crunching boom of the thunder. I
would have expected them to show more alarm, if not actual panic. By the
time the cattle were in, it was still raining heavily, but the storm was sliding on
down the valley.
The calving cow had obviously started, but was not bothering to get on
with it, and we had to get her into the cattle crush so that Jim could do the
job for her. Nor was the calf, when it arrived, very impressed with the outside
world. Although presented correctly and delivered fairly quickly, it made no
attempt to show any sign of life. After being swung vigorously head down a few
times, having a straw up the nose, and other lung inflating treatment, the calf
did eventually start breathing very feebly. We left its mother to make herself
useful and lick it into action, but without too much hope of the outcome. The
possibility of brain damage is always the worry, but the calf was on its feet
the next morning, and Jim only had to attach it to its breakfast for the first
time for it to be no more trouble. I am left wondering whether the cow would
362

Nov 1st

Officials Change the Rules

have calved normally had there been no storm or was she perhaps aware of its
impending arrival and was waiting until it was over?
Sheep certainly seem to be able to decide when they want to lamb. I remember many years ago, with our first small flock of about thirty ewes, finding
nineteen had dropped their lambs unexpectedly in the night during a sudden
brief snowstorm. The ewes with single lambs were fine, but all those with twins
had lost both lambs. The tracks in the snow showed that the single lambs had
been mothered properly, sheltered by the ewe, while the unfortunate doubles
were born a yard or so apart, and the ewe being unable to bring them together,
had spent the night going from one to the other and lost both. What really
puzzled me at the time was why such a large proportion of the flock had lambed
in that one night, when lambing was usually spread over a period of two or three
weeks. The unexpected snowfall was the only logical explanation. Presumably
the sheep instinctively lambed before the weather deteriorated further, but the
ewes carrying twins failed to realise the consequences. Doubtless an experienced moorland shepherd would be able to enlighten me. That was in the days
when we all lambed outdoors, and with a small flock, a look round at midnight
followed by a very early check up in the morning was normally sufficient – but
not that year.
Back in our dairy farming days, we used to think it was just in our imagination that so many of our cows calved on a Sunday. Any extra work beyond the
twice daily milking at the weekend was always unwelcome. Years later I decided
to go back through our calving records and check it out. And to my surprise,
putting the day of the week to the calving dates, I found that statistically our
cows really had preferred Sundays. Less noise and bustle around the farm that
day, or the soothing sound of church bells floating over the hill?

November 1st
Officials Change the Rules
The clocks have gone back, colder weather is forecast and it feels as if winter
is upon us. Or perhaps it is all in the mind. I don’t need an extra hour of
darkness in the evening suddenly thrust on me – I was quite happy for summer
time to last another month. The grass is still growing, the keeping-apples are
still on the trees and Spanish chestnuts are littering the ground in their prickly
casing.
Jim even managed to rustle up enough cider apples to fill a 45-gallon barrel
at a cider-making day with a friend who owns a small press. It’s a long time
since we’ve had any homegrown cider to see off the winter blues, and I eagerly
363

2006
await the first sampling. Any cider I ever made was so harsh as to be considered
almost undrinkable, and a second glassful was generally enough to encourage
the foolhardy to lie down.
Most of the apples Jim collected were from a neighbour’s orchard. We only
have one or two very old cider trees remaining in a small derelict orchard at
the far end of the farm. The orchard is due to be replanted this winter with
local varieties of apple, to restore it to a traditional cider orchard as part of
our ongoing Stewardship Scheme. The accumulated undergrowth of fifty years
neglect has already been cleared, the hedges laid and some of the fencing done,
but the work of planting and staking between thirty and forty standard apple
trees may well be enthused by a flagon or two of the real reason for doing it. I
am not in favour of spending money just to make the countryside look like the
old days. The wildlife in the acre of scrub was probably far happier than it will
be in an acre of well-managed orchard.
That’s not to say that getting involved in the Stewardship Scheme is a waste
of time. We are exactly halfway through a ten-year agreement. So far, 50-acres
of permanent pastures have been managed in a way that encourages a return
to wild flower meadows. Nearly one mile of wildlife margins, six yards wide,
bordering the streams round the farm, has been created. And over two miles
of hedgerows have been laid in and banked up, with three and a half miles of
fencing erected to protect them. On our average size three hundred acre Devon
farm, I think the taxpayer, who has contributed about half the cost, has had
good value for money.
Without the Stewardship Scheme, we would probably only have done the
hedge laying, and that over a much longer time scale. Nor would the fencing to
protect them from the depredations of the farm livestock have been anything
like as sturdy, something that will maintain them with a wider range of wild
plants for birds and insects. In fact, I can quite see a case where a farm is
really strapped for cash, as many are at present, for simply coppicing all the
hedges rather than laying them in and then keeping the flail going every year
thereafter. If Stewardship can help us avoid that rather barren state of affairs
– all credit to it.
This year, having had a very dry summer, which made the driving of fence
posts nigh on impossible on our stonier fields, Jim had left the fencing of last
winters hedge laying, about 1000 yards in all, in the hope that some wet weather
would arrive eventually. He was not unduly concerned since if it was not completed by the end of September, the scheme year-end, it could be easily held
over to later in the autumn. Then suddenly in August, we had a letter saying
that in future no work that we had agreed to do in one year could be held
364

Spending Green Tax Cash

over to a following year, where time or circumstances had prevented its completion. If it was not done in the scheduled year, no grant would be payable. We
checked with our local field officer, who has been extremely helpful throughout,
and it seems that the rules have been tightened up. Jim just managed to get
the fencing done, nearly missing getting our winter oats drilled before the wet
weather set in. But what difference does it make if we claim in a following year
- DEFRA can sit on the money a bit longer – it is pretty good at that. Do I
detect the heavy hand of the new quango, Natural England, which has taken
over responsibility for Stewardship? .

November 8th
Spending Green Tax Cash
The lead letter in ‘Western Morning Views’ on 30 October was illustrated by
a picture of wind turbines against a setting sun, and contained the sentence
“ It is a fact that windfarms cause more damage to the environment in their
construction than they save in 100 years of working life”. My immediate reaction
to such dogmatic statements, and they are being thrown at us continually at
the moment as the ‘global warming’ debate heats up, is to ask ‘who says so and
how do they know?’
On this occasion it was a Mrs M A Naylor from Hertfordshire, and for all
I know, she may well be an expert in the field of wind turbine construction.
Or again, she may just hate the sight of wind turbines, and is deliberately
exaggerating for effect. Whether Mrs Naylor is correct surely depends on where
windfarms are situated, and nothing else.
My reaction to the recent Stern report on climate change is no different.
Sir Nicholas Stern’s proposal that green taxes will solve our problems surely
only depends on what we do with the money generated. If it merely gives the
Chancellor an excuse to raise fuel taxes in an attempt to squeeze us out of
our car and aeroplane seats, making it easier for him to balance his budget, the
amount of fossil fuel used in this often unnecessary activity is unlikely to change
very much. The oil industry, car manufacturers and airline companies will see
to that. If on, the other hand, all the revenue from such a tax is handed over to
David Miliband, Secretary of State for the Environment, to use exclusively for
research and development into other sources of fuel, there might be some hope
of reducing the amount of carbon we are currently flinging into the atmosphere.
Coming nearer home, how will green taxes affect us on the farm? Agriculture is singled out as being particularly damaging to the planet. Not only do we
produce carbon dioxide like any other fuel consuming industry, we are appar365

2006
ently also responsible for emitting two other even more dangerous greenhouse
gasses, nitrous oxide and methane. Raising the existing tax on our farm diesel
would be straightforward, and an increase in the price of nitrogen fertiliser to
reflect any tax increase in the fossil fuel used to produce it, also takes care of
carbon dioxide emissions.
However, I fail to see how it would be possible to levy a green tax on the
amount of nitrous oxide or methane which farming produces naturally. Nitrous
oxide, or laughing gas as it is more commonly called, is emitted by bacteria
in soil, whether farmed or not. And as for methane, cows, while chewing the
cud, undoubtedly belch vast quantities of the gas, but that is nothing new.
Vast herds of North American buffalo, European bison and African wildebeest
were belching methane until quite recently, without apparently damaging the
planet. I have no doubt that a forty page booklet will shortly be arriving
in the post to add to our already extensive collection of must-read DEFRA
literature, explaining how we should encourage our cows and bacteria to behave
themselves.
That leaves us with the new buzzwords carbon footprints, carbon sinks
and carbon trading to get our heads round. If I understand these expressions
correctly, with all the woodland we have on our own farm, we should be doing
rather well here. In fact, with Jim’s 25-acre new plantation, which is now
reaching the stage where there will be massive growth over the next thirty
years, we could well be farming carbon positively, acting as a carbon sink, and
entitled to trade with heavy footed carbon-producing neighbours. How on earth
would that be measured? What a load of utter nonsense, which I hope sinks
without trace.
Thankfully for UK farming, there is a bright side to Stern’s proposal to put
an actual cost on the theoretical damage we may be doing by our excessive use of
fossil fuel. We can forget the expression ‘food miles’; this will automatically be
taken care of in the price of food in the shops. That is if the inevitable squawking
from Australia, New Zealand and South America ever allows agreement on what
that actual cost should be.

Cornish Pasties Origins

Cornish Pasties Origins
With all the troubles there are in the world – Iraq, Afghanistan, global warming
and al Quadia terrorists – it is quite incredible that the origins of the Cornish
pasty should make front-page news. As a Devonian, (although I wasn’t born
here, my ‘Davy’ ancestry goes back to at least 1216 and I have a family tree to
prove it), I feel fully entitled to enter the debate. In the 55 years I’ve lived here,
I have probably eaten nearly a thousand so-called Cornish pasties. Well, maybe
that is a slight exaggeration, but I must have attended countless markets, farm
shows, sales and farm walks in my time and a pasty has always been the fast
food of the day. Whatever the number, it is sad to relate that at least three
quarters of them can in no way be described as a gastronomic delicacy that any
county would wish to be associated with.
The suggestion that Devon invented what is now known as a Cornish pasty,
just because there is a reference in a book of accounts for the borough of Plymouth in the year 1510 itemising the cost of making pasties, is quite ridiculous.
For a start, the ingredients hardly suggest a basic country food. Venison from
Mount Edgecomb in Cornwall, 2s 4d worth of flour and a pound of pepper –
perhaps the chef came across the Tamar as well. According to my dictionary the
word ‘pasty’ derives from the Old French ‘pastee’, meaning a round of pastry
folded over a filling of meat, vegetables, etc. In which case, perhaps Norman
William might claim some of the credit.
No, what really matters in making the Cornish pasty something special is
what goes into it and how it’s made. And here I leave my wife Jenny to have
the last word. She is, after all, as Cornish as they come. I doubt she has a
single drop of Norman or Saxon blood; all her ancestors seem to be buried in
graveyards west of Falmouth, as I have discovered when we’ve visited the places
where her parents and grandparents were born. I can even remember her saying
she felt very strange, as we stood by ourselves on a quiet summer evening among
the ancient habitations of Carn Euny.
Her mother’s recipe for the best Cornish pasties I’ve ever tasted is “potatoes,
swede, onions and beef, all raw (never precooked) and cut fairly small, with salt,
pepper, topped with dabs of butter, encased in pastry made with lard, crimped
at the side (not over the top - how else can a farmer or miner get a hold of it)
and then cooked”. And there you have it. Nothing else is worthy of the name.
Not that I am any kind of a cook, I hasten to add. I can make a pretty nifty
plate of porridge with a microwave and fry an egg, but that’s about all. On the
rare occasions I’ve tried to cook a proper meal, I have found it to be a terrible
367

2006
waste of time, with no appetite left at the end of it. Which is why I get very
impatient with TV cooks, who seem only interested in demonstrating how easy
it is for us all to become ‘cordon bleu’ chefs.
I was particularly incensed with Hugh Fearnly-Whittingstall the other night,
when he decried the use of ready-meals on his ‘River Cottage’ programme, and
put a group of people like me through a cookery course to discourage them from
indulging in such unsavoury practices. I switched off quickly before I could get
interested, but I believe he ended up by taking them to an abattoir, to make
sure they really enjoyed preparing a four-course dinner. What sort of an idiot
is he? Even I avoid trips to abattoirs if at all possible, and sincerely wish all
farm animals could be slaughtered on farm.
In my opinion, what Hugh and all the other celebrity chefs should be doing
is perfecting methods of preparing and packaging ‘ready-meals’, so that after
enjoying the superb cuisine at their expensive restaurants, those who can afford it can take home nearly exact replicas to reproduce in minutes on future
occasions. Rather like buying a CD from the performers after a good concert.
And the rest of us might benefit from a much better quality of ready-meals in
the supermarkets. I’m afraid I am living in a dream world for even suggesting
it. I shall have to manage on Cornish pasties for now.

November 22nd
Moment of Truth Is Near
We are fast approaching the time when we shall find out whether going organic
is the success story it is cracked up to be. I have made no secret of the fact that
I am not over enthusiastic, believing that, like anything else in life, scientific
progress in farming is inevitable and should be welcomed, albeit cautiously.
In the past, I have always been prepared to use nitrogen fertilisers and
chemical sprays in moderation in order to “make two ears of corn or two blades of
grass to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before”, to quote that
well-known phrase from Gulliver’s Travels, which continues “and thus deserve
better of mankind than the whole race of politicians put together”. With all
the disquiet there is about modern farming, Swift might have hesitated to put
it quite like that had he been alive today, but if we are to feed the world
adequately, his words are surely as true now as they were three hundred years
ago.
As an example, if it is correct that the production of nitrogen fertiliser, that
villain of the organic lobby, uses one per cent of the worlds energy supply in its
manufacture but sustains 40% of the world’s population, it is difficult to see how
368

Nov 22nd

Moment of Truth Is Near

we can manage without it. Unless, that is, cereals can one day be genetically
modified to fix their own nitrogen like legumes, a possibility that appears even
less acceptable to almost everyone.
While Jim has probably farmed with more concern for the environment than
I used to do, I don’t think that was the only reason for his decision to convert
completely to ‘organic’. For many years now, it has not been possible to make
a living producing beef from suckler cows without considerable help from the
taxpayer. That incentive is now gone, and since our land and buildings are
best suited to keeping a suckler herd, unless we invest money we don’t have in
alternative enterprises, there are only two real options. We either give up beef
production altogether until it becomes profitable again, which it undoubtedly
will eventually, or we try the organic route, which government and public alike
appear to be demanding.
By the end of April next year, we will have completed our conversion period.
We are already in a position to sell store cattle as organic, provided they go to
a fully organic farm and remain there until after that date, which may be useful
if the coming winter is prolonged and fodder and space become a problem. By
next summer we should have finished beef ready for the market. I don’t think
Jim has any intention of selling direct to the public, he will have too many
animals to make that a practical proposition, so we will be dependant initially
on the price that organic beef is making at the abattoir on the day. Prices
quoted at present sound promising.
At this point, I have to admit that I have never seen the farm looking in
better condition. This may of course have nothing to do with going organic. We
started the transition by clearing out all the young cattle already on the farm
that could never reach organic status. We were therefore very under-stocked for
our first year, allowing the farm to gather strength for this second year. That
has been helped by one of the best grass-growing summers that I can remember.
We seem to have had a flying start, although the organic purists might say that
now we are farming properly the land is bound to look in better heart. We
are back to full cattle numbers and the weather is becoming a little damp for
comfort, so it is perhaps a bit early to get too excited about the future.
As Jim pointed out to me as we were feeding the cattle the other morning,
the number of animals we can keep comfortably on the farm under this system
is all-important. We currently have about sixty suckler cows, which will have
to be reduced anyway in the next couple of years, since half of them are due to
go under the Ministry slaughter scheme for older cattle. A herd of thirty cows
will hardly produce enough income for a fulltime beef enterprise, however good
369

2006
the price for organic beef. I am looking forward to seeing how the next three
years pan out.

November 29th
Old Sow’s Maternal Instincts
The eight little woodland pigs, which Jim released into three acres of overgrown
copse in July, have come to the end of the road. I helped take them early this
morning to a small local slaughter house about five miles from here, to be
transformed into pork, bacon, ham and sausages in time for Christmas. And as
always with pigs, more so than with the other farm livestock, it was a rather
sad occasion. They are such trusting animals.
Although it is a long time since we seriously went in for pig keeping, there
have been very few years when we have had none on the farm. When I began
farming here, I fully intended to run a small breeding herd of Large Whites, to
complement the fifteen Guernsey cows, which were our main enterprise. A Sussex farming uncle, who had promised us a Guernsey cow as a wedding present,
offered to include a pedigree in-pig gilt as a foundation sow.
Uncle Arthur proposed to get them down to Devon using a flatbed farmlorry, suitably converted into a cattle truck with a timber framework draped
in tarpaulin sheets. I went up by train over one weekend, to help load the two
animals, and accompany his lorry driver on the long journey back home. It was
a fairly uneventful trip, but it remains very clear in my memory after all these
years. Our worry was that the animals might decide to try and break out of
what was little more than a tent on wheels.
The cow, a three year-old in-calf heifer, was tethered loosely with a halter
at the front end of the lorry. She went by the unforgettable name of Gorgeous
Gussie, which puts her birth date firmly to Wimbledon 1949, when Gussie
Moran, an American tennis player, having been refused permission to play in
coloured clothing, appeared on court in very visible lace-trimmed frilly white
knickers. Pictures were splashed all over the papers, Wimbledon’s costume
colour bar was in disarray, and Uncle Arthur must have been unable to resist
the name for a newly born Guernsey calf. I am not absolutely sure what the
gilt, which was penned at the back of the lorry, was called, but it was a more
normal pedigree sow’s name like Dainty Lady the 42nd.
All went well, with no audible disturbance in the lorry behind us, until we
were nearly into Devon. Then we noticed that people along the way seemed to
be smiling and pointing as we passed. With some trepidation, we eventually
pulled into a lay-bye to see what was attracting their attention, and found that
370

Dec 6th

Case for Mixed Farming

Gussie, tired of not knowing where she was being taken, had pushed her head
through an overlap in the tarpaulin and was gazing out like some stuffed biggame hunters trophy over the cab of the lorry. The pig was fast asleep in the
straw behind her, and we quickly hurried on without disturbing them.
Both animals did very well for us, living out their full breeding lives. Dainty
Lady grew into a large and prolific sow, averaging over twelve piglets a litter,
and having a very strong maternal instinct. We bred a number of gilts from her,
and even sold the occasional pedigree Large White boar. However there was one
alarming occasion, which might have cut short her time, when Leslie Stagg, of
Dobbs, Stagg & Knowlman in Tiverton, was helping me load two young boars
he had purchased into his pig trailer. The boars were somewhat unwilling, and
said so.
The squeals alerted Dainty Lady, who was newly farrowed in a nearby pigsty
and she joined us by diving through a small high-up window, arriving on the
scene with the window frame lodged firmly round her neck. Assuming that Mr
Stagg was a stranger molesting her previous offspring, she grabbed him by the
mackintosh from behind and flung him to the ground. Before I could get to
his rescue, he stood up, apparently quite unconcerned, dusted himself off and
then calmly helped me return Dainty Lady to her piglets. I have sometimes
wondered since whether, as a novice pig breeder, I would have lived down the
ignominy of allowing such a well-respected Westcountry auctioneer to be severly
mauled by one of my sows.
Subsequently our dairy herd quickly expanded, and we gave up full time pig
farming, but I’ve always retained a soft spot for what are the most intelligent
of farm animals.

December 6th
Case for Mixed Farming
It used to be said that if you were shipwrecked, it was an advantage to have a
farmer among your fellow survivors. I suppose it was felt that all the basic skills
necessary to provide food and shelter were more likely to be found in members
of the farming community than in people from other walks of life. There was
a less complimentary way of making the same observation when I was a lad,
in the oft-used expression that a farmer tended to be a jack-of-all-trades but
master of none.
The idea that farmers can be expected to turn their hands to anything
seems to have largely disappeared in recent years. Obviously the tendency to
concentrate on only one enterprise nowadays to combat the persistent downward
371

2006
pressure on prices has much to do with it. Looking around this neighbourhood,
there are now two or three farms that are arable and nothing else, a few that
depend almost entirely on the price of milk for survival, others that have come
to rely on government support to produce beef and lamb, and increasingly a
number that have gone into free-range poultry on a large scale.
But this idea that specialising is the only way to survive in a tough commercial world was not always the case. In fact, I started farming with what
was a commonly held view in those days that it was dangerous to concentrate
on one enterprise in case the bottom fell out of that particular market. Most
of the farms hereabouts made a virtue of the fact that they sold something of
whatever the land was capable of producing.
On what was perhaps a smaller than average Devon farm we milked a dozen
cows, regularly bought some beef calves to rear on any old or awkward cow, kept
a flock of breeding ewes, grew enough corn for sale to our local miller to help pay
our feed bills, ran about a hundred laying hens in a deep litter system and had
a bacon contract with the nearest bacon factory. I well remember the year that
bacon prices dropped through the floor, we were more than compensated by the
very good price we were getting for our eggs, which were collected weekly by a
local poultry dealer. We once even went in for fattening ducklings, hatched in
incubators, to make use of a rushy meadow, which was a fluke hazard to cattle
and sheep.
This diversity of enterprises was complemented by the extraordinary range
of crops we grew in those days to support it. At one time or another we grew
wheat, oats, barley and dredge corn; potatoes, swedes mangolds and fodder
beet; maize, rye and three varieties of kale for strip grazing; lucerne, sanfoin,
and short term red clover and alsike leys; and a wide variety of grass species
in our grazing ground. It sounds now like a list of crops from some farming
textbook, but they were commonplace on the majority of farms fifty years ago.
Looking back, the retreat from those very mixed systems of farming then
to today’s specialisation is for me the most noticeable and possibly regrettable
change in agricultural life. It has certainly had more effect on the profusion of
farm wildlife than all the sprays and fertilisers put together. In fact, I could
easily suggest that farming has lost a lot of its sparkle and is in danger of
becoming a bore.
However, a chance remark made to Jim by a neighbour had me reflecting
that farming may well be at the start of another period of change. The eight
pigs that Jim had been fattening in an area of woodland this autumn turned out
very well, averaging over ninety kilos on little more than homegrown corn and
what acorns, beech mast and other plant material they could root up. Jim has
372

Dec 13th

Too Many Weather Experts

been curing ham and bacon, and making sausages from the one he is retaining,
and the others have been dispatched to freezers around the parish.
The neighbour’s comment was that while many smallholders aspired to be
farmers, Jim was the only farmer of his acquaintance who aspired to be a
smallholder. Jim, after a bit of thought, took it as a compliment. And, strangely
enough, that cheered me up no end. Better days and greater diversity obviously
lie ahead.

December 13th
Too Many Weather Experts
The early morning weather forecast said that the heavy rain covering Devon
and Cornwall would soon spread to the rest of Southern England. I looked
out of the window to see a relatively clear morning sky above fields white with
hoarfrost. To be fair to the Met Office, although my initial reaction listening
to the radio that early morning had been one of amused derision, it was only a
question of timing and by midday it was as wet as they had anticipated. I know
weather forecasting will never be an exact science, but surely even a Michael
Fish would hesitate to prepare his script on the assumption that his prediction
would be correct by the time he came to read it.
Farmers have always been pretty good at short-term weather forecasting there is plenty of weather lore to back it up, but what we really value is an
accurate forecast for the week or ten days ahead, together with a reasonable
prediction for the following month. In recent years, the weathermen have certainly come a long way towards getting the next five days correct, but beyond
that they begin to drift, and as for the month to come, they tried for a time,
but gave up before they made complete fools of themselves.
As always with anything that isn’t an exact science, life is full of experts. The
threat of global warming is throwing up a positive plethora of experts and for an
ordinary bloke like me it is nearly impossible to know whom to believe. What
makes it even more difficult is the high sounding titles that many of them shelter
under. For example, the current debate on the efficacy of onshore wind power
has gone into overdrive following a claim by the Renewable Energy Foundation
that their expert research shows that unreliable weather will prevent onshore
wind turbines do much to meet the demand for electricity. A year ago, Oxford
University’s Environmental Change Institute published a report which said that
the UK has the best wind resource in Europe and that onshore wind is a costeffective and proven technology. They sound like heavyweight organisations but
they can’t both be right. It would not matter if it weren’t for the fact that vast
373

2006
sums of taxpayers’ money are involved plus a great deal of anguish about the
visual impact of wind farms.
To return to the present, we now have two ‘expert’ forecasts for the months
ahead. One from the Met Office expects temperatures to be “average or above
average with rain at similar levels”, which is apparently consistent with increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The other from a Mr Corbyn, director of Weather Action long-range forecasters, warns us of “significant amounts
of snow and very low temperatures later in the winter”, due to solar activity
and nothing to do with our misuse of the planet. Mr Corbyn has actually gone
out on a limb and is predicting three very severe storms during the next two
weeks, worse than anything we have had so far this autumn, which will at least
give us a chance to test him - that is if we remember what he forecast. And
this is where the experts have the advantage over us. I can never recall at a
later date which expert was talking rubbish and which got it right and should
be believed in future.
If severe weather fluctuations become the norm, it might help if the Met
Office told us on a regular basis how accurately their forecasts were turning
out. For instance, what are the precise odds on their prediction being correct
that this winter will continue as wet as it has been during the last few weeks?
We still have cattle out - cows and small calves which always do better outdoors
- and we have fields with sufficient shelter to keep them out, providing conditions
don’t deteriorate further.
Looking only a few years ahead, it may well be that much warmer but very
wet winters will force us to change the way we have farmed in the past, and put
all our livestock under a roof throughout the winter months just to protect our
fields. But for now, I am inclined to follow my hunch that the weather will, as
usual, become dry, calm and very cold on Boxing day morning, and we shall be
wanting rain by April. If I’m wrong, at least no one will remember.

December 20th
Longer Days on the Way
Another year has rolled by and Christmas time is upon us once again. A few
last minute crowded shopping days to go, some motorway congestion for distant
family to negotiate, the final stocking up of already bursting fridges and we will
be all set for twelve days of celebration. And that’s how it has been in one way
or another for the 4,000 or more years people have been farming, and probably
for long before that.
374

Dec 20th

Longer Days on the Way

Obviously I am not suggesting that we have been celebrating the birth of
Christ all those years at this particular time. And even had we been, St Luke
might have found it difficult to explain why shepherds were watching their flocks
in the fields by night, when sheep in mid-winter in Palestine were safely gathered
into the farmsteads. I understand it was the Romans who, having converted
to Christianity by the 4th century A.D., made the arbitrary decision to fix
December 25th as Christ’s birthday in order to supplant the excessive revelry
of Saturnalia normally held then, and thus conveniently get rid of Saturn, the
Roman god of Agriculture. The way things are now I sometimes wonder why
they bothered, although I know many of us at least make an effort to get to
church if only to enjoy the singing of Christmas carols.
The real reason why settled societies in the Northern Hemisphere, whether
pagan or religious, celebrated at this time, is as basic as the phases of the moon
and the changing of the seasons. It is the timing of the winter solstice, the
day on which the sun reaches it’s lowest point in the sky at noon, the shortest
dying day of the old year. I don’t need a calendar or a computer to tell me
that it falls on the twenty-first day of December, or a henge from which to
make an observation. From my window, I know from past experience exactly
where on the horizon the sun will rise that day, and I only need to see it appear
increasingly to the left of that point every day thereafter, to be assured of longer
days, more warmth from the mid-day sun, and the eventual arrival of spring.
It would be surprising, therefore, if the early farmers, for whom this optimism
had far more relevance than it does for us now, did not at least set a precedent
by feasting for a few days following the solstice.
Today, it no longer matters. We can find reasons to celebrate whenever we
feel like it. It’s not the shortage of food or the darkness of winter that we have
to worry about, and Christmas has just become a habit. But perhaps all is
about to change. The Government has announced it is to spend a hefty sum
of money to frighten us into realising that ‘climate change’ is for real. The
words white and snow are to be written out of the Christmas carols, and the
thinking may be that it is politically expedient to take the word Christmas out
of our-mid winter holiday altogether. Shades of those Roman emperors. If it is
an indication of the sort of schemes likely to be foisted onto a nervous public
to utilise the money raised from a promised carbon tax, we can look forward to
a very warm future.
I was very cheered therefore, when I attended the Devon NFU annual meeting last week, to hear what Dr John Conway, of the Royal Agricultural College,
had to say about the prospects for farming in this part of the world if, or should
I say, as global warming becomes a reality. For a start, he pointed out that car375

2006
bon dioxide, the gas that is causing most of the trouble, is our raw material. It
is essential to plant growth, and more of it should give farming an opportunity
to increase production. For all the scare talk about methane producing cows,
agriculture in fact only contributes about eight per cent of all the global warming gases, and we are the best-placed industry to take advantage of incentives
to produce biofuels and act as carbon sinks. He went on to enthuse us with the
possibilities of farming a much wider range of crops, from olive groves to tea
and banana plantations.
The NFU is currently launching a campaign to change our rather poor image
and explain why farming matters to the nation. If we can be sure Dr Conway’s
enthusiasm for the future of the industry reaches a wider audience, farmers
would really have something to celebrate this Christmas.

January 3rd
Unfazed by Minor Niggles
I have never been one for making New Year resolutions, but I am tempted to
make an exception this time round, if only to avoid becoming a grumpy old
man.
Down on the farm, 2006 was, on the whole, a fairly good year. The weather
seemed to suit us with average crops of hay and silage, harvested without rain
damage. The corn – triticale - came in sweet and dry, and if not a bumper
crop, will certainly get us through the winter. We have had to buy in some
extra straw for bedding, and although the ethics of using straw from a nonorganic farm puzzles me, at least we were able to obtain it locally. If at some
time in the future we are denied this under organic rules, as we surely should be,
we shall have to grow a lot more corn just to produce enough bedding material
– organic straw does not come cheap.
The livestock also performed pretty well after a hiccup early in the spring,
caused by the lack of an essential trace element which we are no longer allowed
to offer the cattle in an ad-lib mineral lick. We lost only one calf as a result, but
gained a hefty vets bill to treat the others, and, eventually, permission from the
Soil Association to add a powdered mineral to the cattle feed. It seems that the
synthetic Vitamin D in the minerals licks is a prohibited ingredient. I wonder
how many people who swear by organic food, are happy to add Vitamin pills
from a chemist’s shop to their diet.
We ended the year with a nice strong bull calf born on Christmas day while
we were doing the morning chores. We had been expecting possible calving
trouble, and even the likelihood of twins, as the young cow was as wide as the
proverbial barn door. By the time we had finished strawing out the yards, the
377

2007
cow had quietly and unnoticed by us got on with the job, and was busily licking
her offspring, already upstanding and looking for its first feed.
So why am I worried about turning into a grumpy old man? The year
seems to have been exceptional in the increased number of minor irritations to
farming life that have occurred on an almost daily basis. If it hasn’t been the
sight of Lord Rooker, the Agriculture Minister, apologising for the umpteenth
time about the Single Farm Payments fiasco in a TV interview, it has been the
arrival through the post of a leaflet about another new regulation, requiring an
application for exemption if it doesn’t apply to us. And a warning that if we
don’t apply, we are more likely to have an inspector descend on us to see why
it doesn’t apply. So we end up filling in a form ticking all the ‘no’ boxes, and
bung it off hoping that will be the last we hear of it.
Unfortunately letters that really matter, such as the one I wrote in June
to DEFRA asking for an explanation of how our Single Farm Payment last
year was calculated, since their brief set of figures which came with it appeared
inaccurate, has never been answered. I am afraid to write again, in case it
merely delays this year’s payment more than last year’s. Or what would be
even more irritating, the possibility of a personal apology from Lord Rooker
himself.
And it is not just DEFRA that is getting up my nose. There seems to have
been a lot of bad-mouthing recently between the NFU and the Soil Association.
The latest bone of contention is the use of nitrogen fertiliser to produce biofuels.
Since we now pay a subscription to both organisations, it is irritating to see them
wasting our money falling out over it. And talking of wasting money, I read that
District Councils are running out of cash for the maintenance of rural roads.
The trouble is they don’t maintain them properly any more, they just patch the
bad places. Our lane is currently a minefield of deep potholes masquerading as
shallow puddles. Even passers by are managing to annoy me. Only the other
day, I found myself disposing of a disposable nappy that someone had kindly
dumped in our road hedge.
I could easily go on, but you can see why I’m alarmed that my sunny disposition is threatened. So I have resolved to be totally unfazed by any minor
niggle the New Year throws at me.

A Tale of Mice and Men

January 10th
A Tale of Mice and Men
There was a dead dormouse on the doorstep of the farmhouse early one morning
a few days after Christmas. It was a male in good condition and had obviously
been placed there by one of the cats as evidence of the night’s hunting. Over
the years, we have had a very wide variety of small animals deposited by the
backdoor, sometimes partially eaten but often, as in this case, appearing almost
untouched except for the obvious ruffling of fur or feathers from being caught.
I assume it is instinctive cat behaviour to contribute to the food supply, but
whatever the reason, it has always given us a very good idea of what wildlife
we have in the vicinity of the farmstead.
At one time or another, we have had house mice, wood mice, common and
pigmy shrews, field voles, bank voles, young rabbits and rats laid out for inspection. Sometimes, but more rarely, there has been a mole or pipistrelle
bat, and on at least two occasions a dead weasel - in fact most of the commoner small mammals, together with the occasional slowworm and common
lizard, and inevitably and unfortunately some of the small birds that frequent
the farm buildings. Not all the work of the same cat, I hasten to add, but a
succession of cats over a period of nearly sixty years.
However never before in all that time have we been presented with a dormouse. I have always looked out for signs of them on the farm, without success.
We certainly have suitable woodland habitat and I know they are to be found
in this part of Devon. It is shame that this first one is a dead one, but since
they live in small colonies, there must be other live dormice not far away. I
shall redouble my efforts during the coming summer to locate them.
Why one has suddenly appeared just now is a bit of a mystery. Warm
days in winter will bring dormice temporarily out of hibernation, and they may
need to look for food at ground level, making them vulnerable to predators.
As a teenager in Surrey, I once kept a family of dormice, a mother and three
small offspring, in captivity through one winter. I had found them in a nest in
woodland in late September, with the babies only a few days old. I was advised
that they had been born too late to survive the cold weather, and their only hope
was to be given food and shelter through the winter months. They certainly
made delightful pets, and although they hibernated for weeks at a time, they
became active on a number of occasions and came out of their sleeping quarters
to feed. Come the following spring, four healthy adults returned to the wild
and I have had a soft spot for them ever since.
379

2007
If it turns out that dormice are now present on the farm, I am wondering what we are doing differently after all this time to make them welcome.
The only likely explanation I can think of is the different management of our
hedgerows after five years of a Stewardship scheme. This, for the first time for
us, involves very strong protection with sheep netting, plus an extra two-metre
width of hedge required by the Single Farm Payment regulations. If so, it will
be an indication on our farm that these grants are giving some wildlife value
for taxpayers’ money.
Although the hedges we have tackled so far will eventually be larger and
bushier, making better corridors for small mammals and nesting sites for some
woodland-edge birds, there is a down side. The grassy banks that used to be
exposed will disappear into the undergrowth, with the loss of many field-side
wild flowers – particularly primroses, bluebells, violets and red campion. And
I doubt if it will do much to encourage farmland ground nesting birds like
yellowhammers.
Obviously to get the most out of these schemes, it needs a variety of environmental managements for each individual farm, and that requires a much better
understanding of the wildlife potential of our farms. Most of us haven’t the
time or expertise to know what is out there to encourage. Perhaps it would be
helpful if the wildlife trusts and bird protection societies spent more time with
working farmers, and less with their nature reserves and pet projects which,
judging from the frequent appeals for extra cash, absorb so much of their members contributions.

Twelve more gone - fifteen left to go. I am referring to the slaughter and incineration of our older beef suckler cows. They are the victims of the Government’s
decision to eliminate by the end of next year cattle born or imported into the
UK before August 1996. It is the final phase of the BSE tragedy, which has
cast such a black cloud over all of us for the last decade.
Unfortunately, more than half our herd falls into this age group. It is always
sad to see cows that have come to the end of their breeding lives loaded up into a
cattle truck for that final journey. It is doubly sad to see perfectly healthy cows,
which are still calving regularly and could continue for a few more years, carted
off to be incinerated to comply with some diktat from Whitehall or Brussels.
Farming leaders encouraged us to agree to the very paltry compensation offered
in order to get the beef export market opened again. While it will have little
380

Scheme Is Bound to Founder

impact on dairy herds, where the majority of cows nowadays rarely live longer
than ten years, suckler herds, with a far lower BSE problem, are once again
bearing the brunt of the ruling for the greater good.
Of the twelve cows we sent away last week, only one, aged sixteen, was a
genuine cull. The others, average age fourteen, with one still going strong at
nineteen, were all in good condition, had good udders and had reared calves
last year. So why did we not forgo any compensation, continue breeding from
them and arrange for their incineration ourselves when they finally reached the
end of the road? It was a consideration certainly, but although there has been
some improvement in the last two years, the market price for beef remains at
or below the cost of production. Only if there is a dramatic improvement in the
next twelve months, is Jim likely to consider keeping the final fifteen cows due
to go then.
All this was brought home to me as I was entering our village post office and
shop ten days ago. I was accosted by a non-farming acquaintance, clutching
a newspaper with the front-page headline “No more grants to grow food”. “I
see that your subsidies are on the way out” was his comment. I replied that
they went two years ago in the UK, although they still exist in some EU states,
but I am not sure he believed me. The misunderstanding is unfortunately the
result of a speech made by Environment Secretary, David Miliband, at this
year’s Oxford Farming Conference. Although I have no doubt he was referring
to the wider European picture, it does leave people with the impression that
food production is still subsidised, particularly with the continuing hoo-ha over
the Single Farm Payments shambles.
I am sure Mr Miliband must be aware that, although many farmers are
inevitably using these payments to prop up loss-making enterprises while they
adjust to the future, the Single Farm Payments Scheme is in no way a food
production subsidy. In fact quite the reverse. It is a positive inducement to
produce nothing at all. Look at it logically. The raft of complex regulations
that have to be complied with to qualify, melt magically away the less the land
is farmed and the less food that is produced. If there are no livestock on the
farm, there are no animal welfare or movement problems. If no crops are grown,
there are no pollution worries. No machinery used, the health and safety boys
are out of a job. In fact hardly any need for a DEFRA inspector to visit – just
a quick look round to check that no illicit farming is taking place, apart from
an attempt to keep the land in good agricultural condition.
I know I’m being frivolous, but that last rather vague proviso – keeping
the land in good agricultural condition – is all that really matters. Unless a
much tougher condition is introduced – something along the lines of a written
381

2007
agreement to immediately plough up land for wheat if required by Government
to provide the national loaf, on pain of eviction as happened in both world wars
- the Single Farm Payment Scheme is bound to founder. The taxpaying public
are simply not going to tolerate the possibility of a farmer packing in active
farming and applying to DEFRA for a job to help get his payments out on
time.

Why I Like the Big Multiples
I am a big fan of the supermarkets. Before you choke on your ‘Tesco own-label’
corn flakes from reading that there is a farmer who actually admits to liking
supermarkets, perhaps I had better explain.
Back in the late 1970s, when we were dairy farming with a herd of Guernseys,
I became very involved with Quality Milk Producers Ltd (Q.M.P.), the dairy
farmer cooperative responsible for the promotion and marketing of milk from
Jersey and Guernsey cows. In those days, doorstep sales of all milk, including
‘Gold Top’, were declining. It became almost impossible to retain the enthusiasm of the milk roundsmen to promote ‘Gold Top’ milk, when the emphasis
from their bosses, the Dairy Companies, was to maintain sales volume at any
price. At Q.M.P. we decided that our only future lay with the supermarkets,
where sales of milk were expanding. This was a completely new venture for us Channel Island milk, as it was known in the trade, having until then only been
sold in glass milk bottles, with a defining gold-foil cap.
There followed ten of the most absorbing and, for me, very busy years.
As Q.M.P. chairman, I found myself commuting on a regular basis to our office at Chesham, in Buckinghamshire, to support a small, but dedicated staff
in the task of patenting Trade Marks for our small but growing number of
brands, devising packaging suitable for retail outlets, and finding Dairy Companies prepared to work with us to process the milk of our farmer members.
And ultimately, of course, to persuade the supermarkets to put our milk and
milk products on their shelves.
To say that I learned a fair bit about what goes on beyond the farm gate
would be an understatement. Up to that time, I had only ventured off the farm
occasionally to make a nuisance of myself at NFU meetings. By the time I
retired from Q.M.P., I had experienced at first hand the very tough world of
food retailing. And, thanks in no small measure to the companies with whom
we collaborated, our milk featured in all the major supermarkets. Surprisingly,
Tesco was the most supportive and gave us our first major break through. They
382

Jan 24th

were not the dominant force they are now – only third or fourth in the pecking
order, which is probably the reason they were prepared to give us a trial run
in the their London stores, from where we went national within a year. Maybe
that attitude is why now, 20 years later, they control about a third of the UK
groceries market.
My feelings about the campaign in my local town of Crediton against Tesco’s
plans for a new store are therefore somewhat mixed. I can understand the
concerns of the small local businesses, but they are surely under greater threat
from Crediton residents, many of whom now live more than an easy walk from
the town centre, driving to a supermarket somewhere else. It seems that there
is similar opposition from many of the other so-called market towns in North
Devon. But none of them are really market towns any longer – they have high
streets and shops, but no real markets except on an occasional basis. They
are becoming dormitory towns, with declining shopping facilities as it is. What
Crediton really needs in my opinion is a large supermarket right in the middle
of the town, with the large car park that goes with it. That would really bring
the town to life and give new hope to the small specialist shops where service
is more important than convenience.
Why not give Tesco the go-ahead, provided they persuade the powers that be
to build a new bypass? Without that, the traffic snarl up which is already nearly
intolerable, can only get worse. The Tescos of this world are loaded, but they are
extremely vulnerable to their competitors. I am delighted to see that the NFU
has at last realised that fact, and is intending to monitor the performance of the
major retailers individually. It will make a change from the blanket disapproval
that farmers have normally accorded them. Regular bulletins about where each
supermarket chain is doing well, together with precise information about what
they are getting wrong, could become very popular with the nations shoppers.
After all, it is our produce that is being retailed; we have every right to be
critical of how it is done, but the NFU is probably the only organisation big
enough to do it successfully.

Amazing Advances in IT
There was a pigeon picking up the grains of corn that were scattered around the
stack yard. It was the summer of 1943 and I was helping with the harvest on a
farm in Surrey during my school holiday. I was up on a rick, passing the sheaves
of wheat from the pitcher to the rick builder when we first noticed the bird.
From the slim capsule strapped to each leg, it was obviously a carrier pigeon,
and work came to a halt while we considered whether we should do something
about it. It was wartime, after all.
The farmer suggested I take a break to see if I could catch it. The consensus
among the workforce was an enlarged version of the upturned sieve supported
by a stick attached to a long piece of string, which was the recognised way
of catching small birds like sparrows and chaffinches. Only for the purpose of
ringing birds for the British Museum, I hasten to add, something my employer,
a keen ornithologist, had been doing for many years.
The pigeon must have been extremely tame or very tired, since I don’t remember having much difficulty enticing it under a small egg crate. The capsules
on its legs did in fact contain rolled-up messages, which although they made
little sense, were in French and signed ‘Night Owl’. I was duly dispatched with
the bird to the local police station on my bicycle. We heard later, unofficially
from the village bobby, that the pigeon had been taken on to wherever it should
flown, and been gratefully received.
I tell this story as an example of how methods of personal communication have been completely transformed in my lifetime. Admittedly telephones
were fairly commonplace in those days and I had experienced using short-range
walkie-talkies in my school Junior Training Corps. Perhaps carrier pigeons are
still used somewhere in the world, but even when I first arrived here in Devon,
the telephone had only just been installed on the farm. Before then, if a doctor,
the police or the fire brigade were needed in an emergency, you got on your
bike. Mobile phones were some distance over the horizon, but that is as far as
it went. So it is quite extraordinary that now, using that same telephone and
a small personal computer, an invention inconceivable in 1943, I can read messages and view photos on the internet that have reached me almost instantly
from anywhere in the world. And with close relatives living about as far away
as it is possible to be, it is a pleasure I am happy to take advantage of.
However, if anyone had told me, as I cycled to the police station with a
pigeon in a cardboard box on that day long ago, that the time would come
when it would be considered reasonable for a soil-stained peasant to be able to
384

send personal messages to the Minister of Agriculture, I would have answered
“not in a thousand years”. I am referring, of course, to that latest phenomenon,
the Miliband ‘blog’. I have been viewing it on the internet with some scepticism.
David Miliband, or one of his underlings, set it up when he first took office as
Secretary of State at DEFRA, as a personal journal of his day-to-day ministerial
duties to, as he put it, help bridge the gap between politicians and the public.
It is either a clever piece of official propaganda, as I originally believed, or a
genuine attempt to prove he’s a ‘regular guy’ and an approachable one at that.
There is an open invitation for anyone to comment by email on what they read,
or even send answers to hypothetical questions he raises. I have so far resisted
the temptation, but who knows, the day may come. I imagine that at least one
member of DEFRA staff must already be employed sorting the wheat from the
chaff, as it were.
The ‘blog’ idea also seems to be infectious. Mariann Fischer Boel, the EU
Agriculture Commissioner, set up her ‘blog’ a week ago. It looks much too
professional compared to our David’s and is unlikely to survive for long. It
misses his light touch as some random jottings in his diary before turning out
the bedside light. However I hope they both realise that it is actions not words
that matter to farmers, and in the end that is what their time in office will be
judged on.

February 7th
Keeping Co-ops Focused
I was pleased to see that Milk Link members are at last about to receive their
first dividend on their investment in the Plymouth-based farmer cooperative. I
really have no right to comment, since I am not a member of Milk Link and do
not milk cows, but this is a very positive step, which must give dairy farmers
in the region real encouragement for the future.
I have always believed that cooperative marketing, both buying and selling,
is vital to the survival of the smaller, family run farms, particularly here in the
South West where we are still the backbone of the agricultural industry. Not
for us as yet, the vast industrial style farms, like the Bernard Matthews empire,
which we are seeing daily on our TV screens following the disastrous bird-flu
outbreak of last week. Unfortunately, we have a poor reputation for giving our
cooperatives our full support once they are established and running successfully.
We tend to leave them to run themselves, while we go back to minding our own
businesses.

I recall standing on a sunny afternoon with a large crowd of farmer shareholders in the lorry-park of North Devon Meat, at Torrington. We were there
to decide the future of the state-of-the-art abattoir which had, over a period
of years, been successfully developed into a business large enough to trade on
equal terms with any retail outlet in the country. It had overreached itself
and got into financial difficulties, and although it was brought back into profit,
with all the farmers who were owed money fully paid up, it never recovered the
confidence of its members. It was eventually sold and now, years later after
a succession of owners, the abattoir stands silent, a mothballed monument to
farmer apathy. I often wonder if just a proportion of the hundreds of farmers
present that day had attended Annual Meetings regularly to ensure that the
cooperative kept their interests at heart, we might today be in possession of an
asset worth nearly as much to livestock farmers in this part Devon as the very
land on which we rear and fatten our cattle and sheep.
Maybe attending AGMs would have made no difference, but since then I
have always been a great believer in trying to be at the annual meeting of any
farming organization to which I belong. We are fortunate in the South West in
have a number of buying groups, which have grown and flourished over the last
fifty years, so that between them they now almost monopolize the purchasing
side of our farming businesses. Where they were originally instrumental in
allowing us to buy all we needed wholesale, rather than retail, which was how
things were when I started farming, our farmer cooperatives have themselves
become retailers to the wider public, and very successful retailers at that.
Mole Valley Farmers is the most obvious example. Founded in 1960 by a
small group of determined farmers, led by John James, the cooperative has
done more for us by bringing down the cost of feed and fertilizers than anything
farmers have achieved negotiating with the politicians since those days. Its
growth can only be described as phenomenal – visiting the headquarters branch
at South Molton, I am almost persuaded that I have mistakenly wandered into
a Tesco’s. But even with a company as successful as Mole Valley, we would be
stupid to relax our vigilance.
Fortunately for us, since retiring as Managing Director some years ago, John
James has taken on the role of acting as the conscience, if that is the right word,
of the shareholders. A year never passes, but I am reminded by John that an
annual meeting is due, that I must attend and muster as many farmers as
possible to come along. Our farmer directors and senior staff, who do a great
and sometimes thankless job, need us to show our continuing support by being
there and offering what I am sure they see as constructive criticism. John has
recently set up a website – www.molevalleyfarmerscooperative.com - to use as

a forum for discussion on how we want Mole Valley to go forward. How else
can a successful business thrive?
This year’s AGM takes place tomorrow, Thursday February 8th, at the
Dartmoor Lodge, Ashburton, at 2.30pm, and I look forward to meeting many
old friends and acquaintances at what I hope will be a well attended meeting.

February 14th
Harvesting Trees Each Century
One of my biggest regrets nowadays, with all the talk of global warming, is
that I never kept a diary of weather conditions here on the farm. I tell myself
that I was just too busy working outdoors all day and too tired, or perhaps
too idle, to do anything in the evening that involved writing. Had I done so, I
would at least have some personal evidence to convince me that climate change
is really happening. Because, if it were not for the pictures on television of
melting ice sheets at the poles, weighty reports by scientists in the newspapers,
monthly statistics of record breaking temperatures by weather forecasters, and
dire warnings by politicians, I would be inclined to disbelieve it. The conditions
at present are certainly unusual, but has our weather ever been otherwise?
I can recall some very hot summers in the 1940s, with temperatures well
into the nineties, generally attributed to sunspot activity. Then there were
the shockingly cold and wet summers of the late 1950s, which we blamed on
atmospheric atom-bomb tests in the pacific. Winters in the past have been
similarly erratic – some when temperatures remained below freezing for days if
not weeks on end, and others when we were turning cows out to newly-grown
grass in late January, with primroses in flower, which is more than can be said
for this year. We used to reckon that seasonal variation went in fifteen-year
cycles.
There is one piece of hard evidence however, which does not rely on computergenerated theories or the consensus of a profusion of climate experts, and which
I can verify for myself. This is the Hadley Centre, Met Office data series, which
records the daily and monthly temperatures of central England from 1659, and
is the longest available instrumental record of temperature in the world. And
I have to admit that, while there have been, in the past 250 years, three 15year periods of abnormally cold weather, this is the first time that a continuous
period of increasingly high average temperatures appears on the graph. What
the planet will do about it naturally is anybody’s guess, and I have heard no
explanation of why temperatures in England in Roman times were apparently
387

2007
similar to those expected by 2050. Time will tell, but unfortunately, like half
the people alive today, I am unlikely to be around to find out.
So assuming that greenhouse gasses are the cause, it is inevitable that we
find ourselves already anticipating what changes we shall need to make to the
way we farm. It has been suggested that we shall get only two seasons – winter
and summer. If this year is anything to go by, it is more likely that wet and
windy autumns will last until spring, with the one missing season being a proper
winter. It wouldn’t surprise me if we find ourselves regularly allowing for half
our hay and silage to be reserved for late summer feeding, in case grass growth
comes to a standstill as it did in 1976.
But that is only looking forward for a very few years. I can easily envisage
what to me seems like a nightmare scenario. With methane reckoned to have
over twenty times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, producing
meat and milk on extensive grazing farms like ours may well follow other farming
systems into the history books. All farm livestock could end up in totally
enclosed sheds like turkeys, for the methane to be extracted as fuel and any
food produced viewed merely as a valuable by-product. Farms like ours will
more profitably be used as carbon sinks and planted up to woodland. That may
appear fairly attractive, but trees only absorb worthwhile amounts of carbon
dioxide while they are growing strongly. To really make an impression on the
atmosphere, trees will need to be harvested regularly, about 100 years for most
species, and replanted. And to complete the picture, the resulting timber turned
into long-lived products or biomass energy.
It so happens that we are in a good position to take advantage of that future.
Whether by chance or uncanny foresight, Jim is already planting new woodland
and turning our mature oaks into sawn wood for timber-frame buildings, oak
beams and other long lasting building materials. I may regret the passing of
the cattle and sheep, but Jim’s carbon footprint will be very light indeed.

Learning From the Past
I do my best to avoid knocking my fellow farmers. Trying to make a living
producing food is hard enough without fighting among ourselves. But all the
publicity of the last two weeks over the outbreak of avian flu in Suffolk has convinced me that it is better to be honest and outspoken about farming methods
if we believe them to be unacceptable ways of producing food. Sooner or later
the systems break down, or are exposed by investigative journalism, and we all
suffer by association from the bad publicity that follows.

Learning From the Past

The Bernard Matthews turkey-meat business is a case in point. Nowadays it
is referred to as factory farming, but it bears no relationship to a farm, turkey or
otherwise; it is merely the production of a commodity in a set of large industrial
buildings.
I am sure it is very profitable, but “bootiful” it is not. Bernard Matthews
may have started his empire as a lad on a bicycle with a clutch of hatching eggs
and a lot of ambition. We all admired his enterprise, and the flair with which
he developed the bucolic image to make a name for himself. Fifty years on and
he now has a company that that has grown so big that when a building full of
turkeys goes down with the flu virus, no fewer than 160,000 birds in that one
shed have to be slaughtered.
Many years ago, I was with a group of farmers visiting Brittany on a factfinding tour of their very successful farming cooperatives. On one of the farms
we visited, the French poultry farmer proudly invited us to see inside his turkeyfattening shed, but only two or three of us at a time. Once inside the reason
was obvious, I had great trouble finding somewhere to place my feet. The
birds, which had reached maturity, were so thick on the ground that if one felt
like dying, there was no space in which it could lie down. And that was in a
shed containing only 500 birds. We left unanimous in our opinion that keeping
turkeys like that was not a humane way to farm. And here we are, years later,
accepting it as normal.
I do not get excited about animal rights or vegetarianism. We are omnivores
and in a perfect world we would eat only the meat of animals that we had
trapped or hunted, allowing them to exist in their natural environment. As
a livestock farmer, I have always felt that we have a responsibility to keep
domesticated farm animals in conditions that at least approximate to their
natural habitat and allow them to live according to their inherent behaviour.
It used to be the accepted wisdom that animals would thrive and stay healthy
if they were kept in groups that were about the size of their wild ancestors.
There are two aspects to this – breeding group size and migratory habit.
Sheep probably have as near to normal lives as any farm animal. Cattle in the
wild certainly lived in very large groups, travelling in migratory herds, but at
breeding time breaking into small units which could be mated by one bull.
That suggests that cows in milk are best kept in groups of up to sixty
animals. So the present trend of rapidly increasing herd size should be a cause
for concern. Surprisingly, there have been very large successful dairy farms in
the not too distant past, which met this welfare problem. I remember Rex
Paterson, in the 1960s, keeping 4000 dairy cows on his farm in Wiltshire, using
a system originated by A.J.Hosier before the war, where the herd was broken
389

2007
down into units of 60 animals, managed by one man milking through a portable
milking bail on separate areas of the farm.
With poultry farming, today’s very large units are even further from the
natural conditions that the birds are suited to. Geese, with an instinct to
migrate and feed in large flocks, probably have the best of it, but chicken and
turkeys are woodland birds, living in small breeding groups throughout their
lives and the least adapted to mass production. I started work on a poultry
farm, where the birds were kept in moveable fold units, about 20 birds to an ark.
The total number of hens may not have matched the size of modern poultry
farms, but the birds certainly thrived and improved the fertility of the land,
without today’s problems of poultry manure disposal. There is still plenty to
learn from the past.

Fruitless Foray on the Internet
A rather unusual letter arrived in the post last week. It was addressed to the
Naval Captain from whom we bought the farm in 1951 and came from a firm
of Westcountry solicitors. Having no forwarding address and being curious that
we might possibly hear something to our advantage, I opened it. It turned out
to be a reminder that they were holding the Captain’s Will and suggested a
meeting to ensure that it still matched his requirements.
I have heard of solicitors losing a Will while someone was still alive, but never
of a Will being jealously guarded long after the individual was obviously dead.
I say obviously because I recall that the Captain, a most colourful character,
was rumoured to have died a few years after he sold us the farm, but had he
survived and is even now living it up in some remote part of the world on
the princely sum of the four thousand pounds that we paid him, he would be
well past his 110th birthday. If the solicitors have had no contact with him
for nearly 60 years, you would assume that they would have checked with the
national records office before going to the expense of opening a correspondence
with him.
Out of interest I tried to see if I could find out through the Internet when
he died. I am sure the information is there, but downloading the long lists of
people with the same name was too time consuming and I gave up. Which is
the problem I have with the Internet; it is a vast source of information, but
there is just too much of it. Without broadband – our phone line apparently
lacks sufficient capacity – life is too short unless you know exactly where to
look.

Fruitless Foray on the Internet

There are two areas of information that I am currently trying to research,
and not getting very far with either. Firstly, I would like to know if it really is
possible to produce worthwhile amounts of ethanol and biodiesel using no fossil
fuel whatsoever in growing the necessary crops, including the production of any
fertilizers and sprays that might be required. In the days of horse power, ten
to twenty per cent of a farm was needed to keep the horses in oats, hay and
grazing. There must be figures available to show what proportion of a farm
would do the same job using biofuels today. Where are they, because I cannot
find them?
Secondly, I would like to be sure that farming organically, as we are now, we
shall not end up using more fossil fuel to power the farm. We shall inevitably
be ploughing up more acres than we have in the past to grow sufficient fodder
to take our animals through the longer winters and drier summers that are
forecast. I see in a recent letter to the WMN, that Riverford Organic Farms in
South Devon have started a two-year project with Exeter University to assess
their carbon usage. More strength to their elbow, and I look forward to seeing
the results of the research.
Unexpectedly, as I trawled through reams of obscure information, I did find
a formula to calculate how large our own personal carbon footprint was. It was
on the website of a company that is offering to plant trees which will over time
absorb the carbon dioxide emissions produced by the prospective customer. In
our case, household and car emissions, including a modest amount of holiday
travel, apparently total about six tonnes per year. For the modest fee of £100,
the company will plant ten trees somewhere on our behalf, which, over the next
sixty years, will more than take care of the damage we have in this one year
inflicted on the planet. They will also provide us with a certificate to prove our
clean credentials.
All very laudable and I have no reason to doubt the integrity of the company
concerned, but this is surely no more than a small Dutch boy putting his finger
in the hole in the dyke as the waters rise. Jim has already planted over twenty
thousand trees on the farm and our neighbour has planted as many again.
Between us, we could probably provide certificates to every household in our
neighbouring villages. But planting trees is no solution, just a regeneration of
the countryside that has always taken place naturally. Anything that deflects
our attention from our reckless use of fossil fuel is doing more harm than good.

Enough Water This Summer
When I was a young lad, to be sure of continuing good luck, on the night when
one month slips into the next you were supposed to say ‘rabbits’ three times
before going to sleep and ‘hares’ three times on waking. How such a weird
incantation originated I have no idea, but I was reminded of it as we were
returning home late one evening last week after watching ‘An Inconvenient
Truth’, the Al Gore film about climate change. I confess I found the film a bit
disappointing – over much of a rather patronising Al Gore, although if it was
only intended for an American audience, that is perhaps too harsh a criticism.
As we turned into our lane, there was a hare loping slowly along in front of
us. I stopped and put out our headlights for half a minute to avoid frightening
her. Sure enough, when I switched them on again, the hare had disappeared,
either turning into a witch and flying away as hares were believed to do in
bygone days, or scrambling over the very high hedge bank that enclosed the
lane on both sides. We do not see hares on the farm very often, although I
know there are one or two around. It seemed a good omen for the coming
month – it was the first day of March.
In fact that whole day had been a very promising beginning of spring –
sunny and warm, if a trifle windy. The ewes, which had started lambing the
week before, suddenly got into top gear that morning, with lambs appearing in
rapid succession. Not to be outdone, three of the last four spring-calving suckler
cows left to calve, produced lively offspring almost simultaneously. It always
amazes me that animals can anticipate a break in the weather and begin the
lengthy process leading up to giving birth. And a break in the weather is all it
turned out to be. Apart from the occasional decent day, we have had periods
of strong winds and lashing rain ever since.
How long this very wet weather is set to continue remains to be seen,
February-fill-dyke having certainly lived up to its reputation. But although
our streams are running bank high and the fields are showing surface water in
places, I am not sure the ground water table is as high as one would expect.
I believe the total rainfall for the winter is about average, which presumably
means that it is coming in such heavy bursts, it is not having time to percolate
down, but is running straight off or into the drains and ditches. If that is so,
I can foresee that when the dry weather does arrive, the ground will become
as hard as concrete almost overnight. By the middle of July our springs and
streams will be dry and we shall be crying out for rain.
We are very dependant on streams as a source of drinking water for our

cattle on much of our grazing ground. A lack of available water can be as
serious as poor grass growth in dry summers. The expense of taking mains
water to all these fields is a pretty daunting prospect, without adding the cost
of South West Water’s escalating water charges. Nor will the effect of very low
or nonexistent flow rates in summer months in future do much for the health
of our rivers. It is often suggested that the draining of farmland is largely to
blame, with the ground no longer acting as a sponge to release water gradually.
While this is probably true, it is not a recent phenomenon. We can find tile
drains under most of our fields and even in some woodland that date back to
the 1830s and stone drains that go back well before that.
Removing drainage systems or blocking up outfalls is out of the question,
but a solution might be the construction of fairly substantial farm reservoirs at
the headwaters of many of our rivers. There are two or three places on our farm
where a simple earth bank in a deep gully could retain millions of gallons of
water, to be released gradually throughout the year. So far as I am aware, such
an idea is completely at odds with the River Authorities thinking at present,
but with their help and collaboration, is it possibly the only obvious way of
overcoming what may well turn out to be one of the more serious side-effects of
global warming?

Challenge of Cheap Imports
I have lost count of the number of times I have been told by exasperated fellow
farmers that it is obviously the government’s intention to get of rid of farmers
and allow all the nation’s food to be imported. It is easy to see how the frustration of trying to make a living, bogged down in the morass of today’s farm
regulations, can provoke such a comment, but I do not believe for one moment
that the government has any such sinister aim. What would be the point –
there are no votes in it for a start? This government is only interested in what
every government has always wanted – cheap food to keep down the cost of
living. And it is now so cheap relative to everything else in life, that even that
is hardly relevant today.
As farmers, we are expected to look after the countryside with the help, if
there is sufficient public support, of taxpayer’s money. If we go in for speciality
and exotic foodstuffs, direct retailing, tourism or the leisure industry, there is
government advice and even financial help available. But producing the basic
agricultural commodities like corn, meat and milk, and we are on our own. The
government has handed over the responsibility for ensuring that the nation is
393

2007
properly fed to the multiples and the food wholesalers. And procurement can
be from anywhere in the world – there is no legal or practical reason to source
our food at home. The idea of national food security is no longer part of the
political agenda; in fact it is probably viewed as interfering with the working of
the World Trade Organisation.
I understand the logic of all this and can even attempt to live with it. Energy
costs and pollution controls will eventually swing the economic advantage back
to national and local production. Meanwhile, leaving us on our own to produce
food at world prices might just be feasible, if it were strictly fair. In practice
we are subject to government interference at every turn and support mechanisms in other countries that make our now-abandoned production subsidies
look positively feeble. Nearer to home, we are certainly capable of competing with our European neighbours on a level playing field, which is what a
Common Agricultural Policy implies, but which our political masters seem very
reluctant to enforce. So the short-term prospects for British agriculture do not
look rosy. The recently launched National Farmers Union campaign to explain
to the public ‘Why farming matters’, although laudable, will be to no avail if
these handicaps are not vigorously challenged at the same time.
Taking ministerial incompetence first, I was disgusted with NFU president
Peter Kendall’s reasons for protecting David Miliband, DEFRA Secretary of
State, at the recent NFU conference in Birmingham, when the questions from
the floor became heated. To suggest that because the minister might become
Chancellor or even Prime Minister at some future date, he should be treated
with due deference to keep him on side is frankly pathetic. I know that exministers of agriculture can now expect to achieve high office regardless of ability, but they are just as likely to fall under a bus while Mr Kendall’s ‘bad
mannered’ farmers are going to the wall.
However the problem of producing food for our own home market against
unfair and in some cases seemingly illegal competition is probably the greater
threat. Why a supermarket is allowed to display on its shelves a food product
from overseas that would result in a prosecution on welfare grounds had it been
produced here is beyond my comprehension. That it was produced legally in
the country of origin should not be sufficient to allow something to be sold
here without a very clear statement of the facts on the packaging. I realise
that that is not going to happen, but I understood that the NFU was going to
start monitoring the supermarkets for this kind of underhand trading. Why not
begin immediately by challenging publicly the ethics of individual stores that
are selling foodstuffs that fall into this category? I believe pork imported from
just across the channel is an obvious example.

Syringes Worked a Wonder

It is high time we made a real stink about it. Because if we do not, the worry
that farmers will begin to disappear with all our basic foods being imported
may well happen by default. And if that process goes too far, it may become
impossible to reverse when we need to. That is why mainstream farming really
does matter.

March 21st
Syringes Worked a Wonder
One morning about three weeks ago, Jim began the day’s work to find that we
had a downer cow. Every farmer will probably have experienced the sinking
feeling you get on these occasions as you realise that, hard as she tries, the
cow cannot get up. It generally occurs after a difficult calving, when a nerve
in the pelvis gets trapped, but this cow had been calved some months and it
looked more likely that she had been injured by the attentions of an excessively
exuberant bull.
The vet was summoned to check for any broken bones or other damage to
the hindquarters that would require immediate slaughter on humane grounds.
He found nothing serious enough to prevent her recovering, given time, but as
a precautionary measure he injected some anti-inflammatory drugs, which cost
us an arm and a leg, but did nothing for the cow. Our vet is doing pretty well
out of our conversion to organic farming. We tend to call him out every time
an animal shows signs of ill health even though we may be pretty sure of the
cause of the trouble. It makes life much simpler when accounting to the Soil
Association for medical treatments that have been administered, and in any
case, if our animals are worth so much more to the public, we should be able
to afford the increased vet’s bills.
The cow, which seemed in no real pain, was enclosed with some gates to
keep her safe from being trampled by the other cattle, and fed and watered
where she lay. After a fortnight, she had still not got to her feet, but could
only sit up using her front legs, with her hind legs doing little to help her move
around. Jim was beginning to consider ropes and hoists to get her standing,
but it is a miserable and time consuming job, not to be entered into lightly and
often causing the animal more harm than good.
Then last week, our annual TB test was due and the vet arrived to give the
cattle their preliminary tuberculin jabs. The downer cow being unable to go
through the cattle crush with the rest of the herd, the vet had to climb into her
pen to do her where she lay. The cow, seeing him advancing with two syringes
at the ready, promptly got to her feet, as if to indicate that no more of that
395

2007
treatment was necessary. The original injections may not have done her much
good, but the memory of them seems to have served a useful purpose. She is
still unable to walk properly, but she can now stand up and will hopefully make
a complete recovery.
Happily, we also got through the TB test completely clear with no reactors.
Why we had a problem two years ago, with two animals slaughtered and four
other reactors, we shall never know. If the cattle really had TB on that occasion,
surely such a contagious disease should have spread to some of our other animals
by now. Or am I to conclude that we were closed down from selling cattle for
no good reason?
At least at the time, we were properly compensated for the loss of the
two heifers slaughtered. Now, under the new compensation tables that have
been introduced because the government is finding the cost of dealing with TB
running out of control, we would have received barely half their value had we
lost any animals on this occasion – organically assured cattle are valued at
the same rate as non-organic cattle for some strange reason, given the official
encouragement to farm in this way.
Having a clear TB test does mean we can sell any young stores we want to
market during the next sixty days without the added expense of another test
under the new regulations that were introduced this month. What prevents
these animals picking up TB during this time from a wildlife source, which may
well have been the cause of our original failure, I have no idea. With no attempt
to deal with this possibility, the whole exercise looks like another futile gesture
by Ben Bradshaw, the DEFRA minister responsible for animal health and the
State Veterinary Service, with farmers and the taxpayer forced to pick up the
bill. It is high time he was moved, perhaps back to the Foreign Office where
he began his ministerial career, to rejoin his erstwhile boss, that other DEFRA
disaster, Margaret Beckett.

Why Cut the Front Lawn
I could put it off no longer. It was a sunny Saturday afternoon with summertime
due on the morrow and my least favourite job beckoning. I got the lawn mower
out of the barn and yanked hopefully at the starting rope. I say “hopefully”
because with a bit of luck, and the fact that I hadn’t emptied the petrol out as
one is supposed to do when laying up for the winter, the mower might refuse to
start. Taking it to the local agricultural engineers for an overhaul could delay
396

Mar 28th

Why Cut the Front Lawn

things for another week, but unhelpfully, at the third or fourth pull, the engine
sprang to life and I was forced into action.
Why am I making a fuss about mowing a bit of grass not that much bigger
than a pocket-handkerchief in front of our house? The truth is that it has not
been cut since last May and now, after the mild and wet winter, looked almost
like a silage crop. Try tackling that with a push lawn mower – five yards and the
grass box is full. However, with the help of the quad bike trailer to transport
the grass, I had completed the job by dusk and the most deserving of the cows
had had a foretaste of things to come.
Turnout time for the cattle cannot be far away. Our grass fields are looking
very green, if not quite as forward as they would have been in the old days after
an early dressing of nitro chalk. We are starting our third year farming organically with the conversion period virtually over, so that any lingering inorganic
residues should be completely gone. Obviously, the fields that were shut up
first last autumn are very much further forward than the remainder and will be
grazed first, but the distinction seems more pronounced than usual. Whether
this is the result of an unusual winter or the change to organics, only time will
tell. In future judging when to take the cattle out of grass fields may become
more important than deciding when to put them in.
Meanwhile Bev, my daughter-in-law, has had a very successful lambing, with
all but half a dozen ewes dropping their lambs over a three-week period to the
middle of March. The older of our two rams was dispensed with last year and
not replaced, so the surviving ram did well to get such a large proportion of
the ewes in lamb at the first attempt, so to speak. Bev has reduced the flock
somewhat, but even allowing for that, I am always amazed at how many ewes
one ram can cover.
The next big question, of course, is where will the lambs, which should be
ready for the market from the end of May onwards, be sold. They will be our
first organic produce and as such cannot go to our nearest and usual abattoir,
which does not market organic sheep or cattle. We are also aware that the
difference in price between organic and non-organic is nowhere near so marked
for lamb as it is for beef. Whether it is due to a misguided perception by the
public that all lamb is organic anyway, I don’t know, but unless one is producing
for direct selling through a farmers’ market or farm shop, it must be doubtful if
going organic is economically worthwhile for farmers with sheep as their main
enterprise.
To return to my lawn mowing routine, or rather lack of one, I made a big
mistake last autumn when I left the summer’s growth to stand through the
winter. I had expected it to die down to a cuttable height by the spring, but
397

2007
aside from that, I think my exercise in idleness produced a distinct improvement
to the look of the garden. I am no great shakes as a garden designer, but a
rough approximation to a wild flower meadow is surely more attractive than
an area of pseudo green baize. Why do we have this fixation with a neatly
mown lawn? Unless we are enthusiastic croquet players, or anxious to instil the
rudiments of cricket and football into our newly walking toddlers, or even, God
forbid, setting aside lavatorial areas for our family pets, what purpose do lawns
serve. There must be a million acres of lawn in Britain doing nothing more
than providing people with some weekend exercise burning fossil fuel. Perhaps
all that will become a nostalgic memory in the years to come, after the global
warming police have had their way.

April 4th
Cheap and Affordable
I have discovered that the words “cheap” and “affordable” can mean very different things when used by politicians, food retailers or farmers to describe food
prices. I was attending a South West Excellence debate in Exeter last week,
entitled “Sustainable Food Supply – Do you have an appetite for saving the
planet or for cheap food?”
Ben Bradshaw, Environment Minister, the first speaker, immediately replaced the word “cheap” with “affordable”, and went on to suggest that the
question for debate was a false choice, allowing himself the freedom to avoid
giving a proper opinion on the subject. He said the government was working
with the industry to allow consumers to make the decision about saving the
planet through better labelling of a food’s origin and carbon footprint. Tory
MP Peter Ainsworth and Baroness Miller for the Liberal Democrats picked up
on the word “affordable”, and followed roughly the same line, but with no suggestion that food might perhaps be too cheap – why else the excessive wastage
and increasing obesity? It is always depressing when possible adverse voter
reaction turns opposing politicians into willing if uneasy bedfellows.
The speakers for the two major retailers, Tesco and McDonald’s, also adopted
the description “affordable”, but it was obvious that they were using the word
in the sense that some retailers are more affordable than others, presumably
concerned for their own survival. However, they were both at great pains to
emphasise their green credentials and preference for buying local.
At that point, it looked as if any meaningful debate was all but dead, until
the cavalry came to the rescue in the shape of the final delegate, Anthony
Gibson, the NFU Director of Communications. He produced graphs to prove
398

Apr 11th

Why All This Dairy Elation?

that food is indeed extremely cheap, in some cases below the cost of production,
and that a sustainable main stream UK food supply will be impossible, green
or otherwise, unless farmers can afford to produce it.
Had he stopped there, it might have been game, set and match, but Anthony spoilt the argument for me by suggesting that our future lay in high
quality, locally produced food, giving the consumer a sense of place. If we are
seriously concerned about an adequate supply of food against a backdrop of climate change, local becomes meaningless. We have hardly begun the process of
limiting greenhouse gasses. The rate at which world temperatures are currently
rising, could easily produce severe crop failures in the next few years anywhere
in Europe. If farming is not actively encouraged to succeed wherever weather
conditions permit across the continent, we may all end up seriously short of
food and affordable price will cease to be a defining consideration.

April 11th
Why All This Dairy Elation?
I have a horrible feeling that UK dairy farming, as we have known it, is sleepwalking into the history books. I do not mean, by that rather trite remark, that
there will soon be no British milk or dairy products on supermarket shelves –
these will continue to be filled, but increasingly by large food producing companies of ‘Bernard Matthews’ proportions. But what I simply fail to understand
is why there is all this industry euphoria about Tesco’s decision to offer 850
dairy farmers a 22p/litre fresh milk supply contract.
It is certainly good news for Tesco’s board of directors. Their staff, who are
responsible for retailing over a quarter of the nations liquid milk market, have
at a stroke, secured their source of supply direct from farm, effectively bypassing the processors and appearing to the public as a big hearted organisation
concerned with the plight of the nations dairy farmers. Very nice for the 850
farmers concerned, but not so good for the other farmers who also supply the
two milk-processing companies involved, since their milk price, which presumably is an average of liquid and manufacturing sales, will now be reduced by
the amount paid to the select top cats. I was going to say fat cats, but even
22p/litre is not that generous, when you consider how much the shopper pays
for a litre of milk.
I thought that, as farmers, we were being encouraged to cooperate to secure
better returns from the market place. Why therefore are we making such a big
deal about something that appears to fly directly in the face of such advice?
Not that I blame Tesco for taking this action. It is not an altruistic organi399

2007
sation; it is a very successful multinational company, which one has to admire
for its business acumen, even while enduring the tough treatment it hands out
to us, its suppliers. In this instance, Tesco is only following the example of
the smaller retailers who are already being supplied through direct farmer contracts. But if the other major supermarkets fall into line, as we seem to be
encouraging them to do, it will not be very long before all liquid milk sales, the
most valuable proportion of the nations milk production, will be secured for the
fortunate minority, and the remaining dairy farmers, perhaps the smaller and
more vulnerable producers further from the market, will have to survive on the
inferior returns from the sale of cheese, butter and the other manufactured milk
products.
You can forget Tesco’s secondary plan to sell milk under a “local” brand,
supposedly in response to growing public demand, sourced from a mere 150
farmers receiving a charitable 23p/litre, and giving shoppers the chance to pay
more if they wish to support small producers. It is pure window dressing in fact, it is downright insulting. I’ll be surprised if the scheme lasts twelve
months, by which time it will be announced that sales are poor (who will be
able to prove otherwise?), and the brand will be quietly dropped.
My years as a dairy farmer are long gone, but there was a time when I
was very involved with a dairy farmers’ cooperative and experienced at first
hand the problems of dealing with the supermarket milk buyers. If there was
one lesson I learned from those days it was the absolute necessity of denying
them the chance to interfere with the loyalty of our members. It was openly
admitted that had we allowed any fragmentation to occur, we would have lost
any influence we had in the market place. Today, that small farmer cooperative
is still very much alive, and the milk from our members is available in all the
leading supermarkets.
I have many friends here in Devon and Cornwall, who are dairy farmers. I
know they are doing their utmost to build large producer cooperatives to bargain
with the Tescos of this world from strength. Perhaps they are at last beginning
to succeed, and the multiples, instead of paying the 22p/litre for liquid milk to
be shared equally among all milk producers as it should be, are anxious to head
off any threat to themselves by offering to make some producers more equal
than others. And what sort of encouragement does that give to those local
farmers, who are giving their valuable time to making these farmer businesses
successful, when farmers’ leaders appear to be welcoming the exact opposite of
what cooperative marketing is all about?

I have nothing against the Welsh. Quite the reverse - I have had a very soft spot
for Wales ever since I was evacuated there as a ten year old at the beginning
of the war. The boys’ school, where I was a border when war broke out, was
located in Hove. Worries that German bombers might soon start attacking
towns on the south coast persuaded the authorities to move us, about 50 boys,
aged between nine and thirteen, with four or five of the older masters and a
matron, to an old manor house half way up a mountain not far from Harlech.
That was in the autumn of 1940 and the following two years were probably
the happiest of my school days. The rather rigid discipline of a boys’ boarding
school situated in a town, with only the occasional outing away from the school’s
sports field being in a well guarded pavement crocodile, suddenly changed to
the undreamed of freedom, when classes ended, of being turned loose into the
North Wales countryside. We played some cricket and football certainly, but
the pitches were very makeshift and the cowpats had to be cleared before a
game could begin.
So, as often as not, we were left to our own devices, exploring the countryside
on bicycles, camping out in the woods, learning to fish in the nearby river, and
taking turns to ride up into the hills on a couple of unbroken Welsh ponies that
the school had acquired to further our education. Galloping across farmers’
fields, being greeted by a few incomprehensible words and a cheery wave of
the arms, was how I gained my only phrase in the Welsh language. I did
not discovered until some months later, having used the greeting on a number
of occasions to complete strangers, that the words even when translated into
English, were not readily understandable to a lad of my tender years.
By 1943, I was back in Surrey, completing my education amid the doodlebugs
and V2s, and hearing the Wellington bombers droning through the night on
their way to bomb the living daylights out of German towns about the size of
Hove. I have enjoyed going back to Wales on many occasions through the years
since then, and once seriously considered looking for a small farm in Wales
rather than Devon to get a foot on that bottom rung of the farming ladder.
Who knows, had I done so I might be there yet. And, if so, I probably would
not be writing this. Because the reason for this bit of nostalgia is the arrival
in the post of the “exemptions to waste regulations” paperwork, which I finally
got around to applying for last week, and which must be completed by 15th
May.
I pulled out the main 40-page booklet, and found to my surprise that it was
401

2007
all in Welsh. I was reaching for the phone as I skimmed through it, to inform
the Environment Agency of the mistake, when I discovered that at the halfway
point I was reading upside-down English. It turned out that if I turned the
whole thing over and started from the other end, I had the English version.
Very clever. The actual form on which to apply for the waste exemptions was
similar – ten pages to reply on in English one-way and ten pages in Welsh the
other. There were a further thirty pages of 67-frequently-asked-questions, half
in each language, making a total of 90 pages - printed, as the Environment
Agency is quick to point out, on 100 per cent previously used waste.
If, as is claimed, over 100,000 of these packs have so far gone out to farmers,
the Environment Agency has already managed to load us down with nearly five
million pieces of A4 paper, half of which was waste for a second time even before
it left their offices. Are the Welsh so concerned about their identity that we
really need to go to these lengths? We already have UK cattle passports written
in both languages to keep them happy. I am told that if we do not apply for
any waste exemptions, we are almost certain to receive a visit from the waste
police. We only want to be allowed to burn hedge trimmings and clean out the
occasional ditch. I am very tempted to use the Welsh half of the application
form. If this results in the Environment Agency sending out a Welsh speaking
official, I shall at least know how to greet him.

Driest April for 69 Years
We have had a little rain at last, and more is forecast. I would be happy for it
to go on raining for three more weeks at least, although I may get to regret that
remark. The driest April since 1938, which I understand is where we have been
heading, is certainly not conducive to bringing any May flowers to this farm. I
don’t know if it is the current preoccupation with climate change, but unusual
weather conditions seem to have the experts rushing to make comparisons with
seasons past - the further into the past the better.
1938 is not really all that long ago. Even I can remember it pretty clearly,
not the actual dry April, but the scorching days in May that followed, when the
temperature reached 90 degrees F, and the headmaster of my prep school, who
was reputed to have had trials for Sussex in his younger days, was forced to
cancel afternoon cricket on orders from the matron. It was apparently the first
time such an unthinkable decision had been made since the school was founded
50 years before, but there was no anxiety about global warming then.
402

Driest April for 69 Years

What is more worrying now is the succession of drier summers we have been
experiencing lately. If these continue, we may be in serious trouble with some
of the grass fields that we put into the government’s stewardship scheme. For
the past six years, these have been managed to allow them to revert wild flower
meadows. Under the rules of the scheme, these fields receive no manure of any
description, and have to be grazed by a restricted number of animals in the
summer months only, to keep the grass to a set height. We receive a grant for
part, but not all of the loss of income that we might otherwise be able to earn
from this ground. These days, the government call it ‘green farming’.
The problem with the drier weather is that already this year, the springs
and small streams that the cattle rely on for drinking have virtually dried up.
Farming normally, we would wait until late in the autumn, when the springs
are running again, and graze what by then will be some very tall coarse grass.
How we are expected to manage this ground in these circumstances as a flower
meadow, I have no idea. I hope Natural England, which is the new government
body now responsible for these green schemes, will tell us.
I doubt if the general public is aware that payment for green schemes is
derived from something called modulation – a word normally used by musicians
to describe changes in tone or pitch, but coined by some official in Brussels as
a nice obscure word to hide what is simply a deduction from EU farm support
payments. Over the years, this deduction has been set at around five percent.
Last year, our Chancellor, well known for his aversion to farm support of any
kind, managed to get agreement, during some difficult European negotiations,
for individual nations to set additional deductions, cleverly called voluntary
modulation. Oh, it’s voluntary all right for Gordon Brown, our Prime Minister
in waiting, but it will be compulsory for British farmers, the only nation to
introduce it apart from Portugal, where eighty percent of the farmers are too
small to be taxed in this way.
So, in future, it seems that English farmers will have their Single Farm
Payments, already mismanaged by the fiasco of its introduction, reduced by
a further 12 – 14 percent, the level at which this new tax is being set. That
should give us a great competitive advantage over our European neighbours, I
don’t think. To rub salt into the wound, DEFRA Secretary David Miliband,
not now a possible Prime Minister in waiting but probably in line for promotion
for promising to support Gordon Brown, is claiming that English farmers will
be better off with high rates of national modulation as, with extra Government
support, there will be more money available for green schemes from 2007-13.
Come on David – pull the other one. You conveniently forget that it is
our own money we will be reclaiming and that in order to make these green
403

2007
schemes work, more of our own money and resources has to be used, for no
actual economic advantage. It may be great for the environment, but many
of us could well be better off avoiding green schemes altogether. We have an
increasingly tough world out there to contend with.

New Law on Use of Byways
That delightfully humorous poem by G.K.Chesterton, which begins with the
lines “Before the Roman came to Rye or out to Severn strode, the rolling English
drunkard made the rolling English road”, is really wide of the mark. It was only
during the 18th century, with the advent of horse drawn vehicles, particularly
stagecoaches, that the bends appeared in our roads, as they were realigned
to allow horses to manage the steep inclines, which existed before that time.
William Marshall, in his “The Rural Economy of the West of England” of 1796,
says that there were virtually no wheeled vehicles in use in the region in 1750.
This explains something that puzzled me when I first came to Devon. Beyond our farm, our lane becomes unfit for motors, but joins what appears to be
a very old green byway heading south for nearly three miles directly towards
Crediton, our nearest market town, before rejoining a metalled road. A century ago, there were five small farmhouses along this route, of which only one
remains. Like many lanes in the Westcountry, there are very few places where
it is wide enough for even the smallest carts to pass. In narrow lanes, cars are
easy enough to reverse to wider spots or gateways - in fact, over the years, one
develops the ability to drive backwards as fast as it is safe to drive forwards.
But how did farmers manage in the past? Presumably they cursed at having to
back a horse and cart for thirty or more yards, and kept their hedges trimmed
as low as possible to see what was approaching.
It is only recently, while reading up on the history of our rural roads, that I
realised that this was only a temporary state of affairs. The farms hereabouts
existed long before 1750, which is evident from the age of the farmhouses. Roads
were plenty wide enough for travelling on foot, on horseback or moving goods
by packhorse, but were never intended for wheeled traffic. The green byway
adjacent to us was definitely used as a drove road until as late as 1890, indicating
that it was part of an ancient route between towns rather than villages. One
of the farms it passes is named Harestreet, a Saxon term for a military road,
which dates the route to pre-Norman days. It continues northwards beyond us
towards the site of an Iron Age Fort on a neighbouring farm, so was possibly a
footpath for thousands of years before that.

Return of Myxi to Rabbits

Since I have been here, this historic old road, like many others in Devon
and Cornwall, has declined to a drowsy bridleway, unnoticed by long distance
travellers, becoming little more than a grassy farm track, used occasionally by
agricultural contractors as a short cut and as a right of way for people walking or
on horseback. That is until the last few years, when it has unexpectedly taken
on a new lease of life, becoming a recreational route for different and sometimes
conflicting groups of users, and stirring up the feelings of local residents. And
it is once again wheels that are causing the trouble, in this case noisy and
damaging wheels.
Ramblers and horse riders seem to get along together, except perhaps where
hooves have churned up the wetter ground, and the quiet of the countryside
remains undisturbed. But the use of the track by trail riders with their motorbikes and off-roaders with their 4X4s has really upset the applecart - not just
here but on similar old roads all over the country. The government has become
involved, introducing Acts and Orders and Public Inquiries.
I attended the Local Public Inquiry in our parish hall last week, which was
hearing evidence to base a decision on who should be allowed to use our green
lane and two others in the village. A year ago, a similar Inquiry modified all
three routes to become Byways Open to all Traffic. The ink was hardly dry
on that decision when the law was changed and users of mechanically propelled
vehicles found themselves having to prove they had used the routes in recent
years as regularly as other users. It may be that our Byway will be modified
once more and become a Restricted Byway, with motor vehicles banned. For
the first time, sadly, the old road will not be open to all travellers, passing
farmers on tractors included. Perhaps that is a price we have to pay for its
continued existence.

Return of Myxi to Rabbits
I see that myxomatosis has reared its ugly head on the farm once more. We
do not have many rabbits to worry about these days; in fact their presence
in the fields is virtually unnoticeable. The few there are seem to be mainly
concentrated along one particular length of road hedge that is riddled with
holes, baby rabbits scuttling for cover through the summer months to avoid
passing cars. The hedge is due to be laid some time soon, when the hedge-bank
will also have to be renewed. That may remove what could be the current source
of infection, which breaks out every so often as numbers build up. I don’t like
seeing myxi rabbits about – it is a horrible disease, although it certainly keeps
405

2007
the rabbit population under control. That is more than could be said for gin
trapping, thankfully now illegal, which was almost as horrible but nowhere near
as effective, as we found to our cost when we started farming here in the early
1950s.
The myxomatosis virus, which is tolerated by South American rabbits where
it occurs naturally, was initially deadly to European rabbits. The disease had
already been used to bring the rabbit population under control in Australia
when a doctor, living on a rabbit-infested estate near Paris, introduced it in
1952 to France. In view of the concern today about another lethal viral disease,
bird flu, mutating to become contagious to humans, it seems strange that a
member of the medical profession should have risked bringing myxomatosis to
Europe. It was discovered in Kent in 1953, but how it reached England remains
a mystery. Whether farmers or our Agriculture Ministry were involved in what
otherwise may have been an accidental channel crossing, we shall probably never
know, but it looked as if it would wipe out wild rabbits completely.
With the Government’s determination to increase home food production wartime food rationing was still part of every day life until 1954 - the eradication
of what had been for many years the most serious of pest of Britain’s farmland
was more than welcome. Even for someone like me, weaned on a diet of books
like Beatrix Potter’s Peter Rabbit, the prospect of a rabbit free countryside
raised hopes of making a success of farming in Devon. Ours was possibly the
most rabbit-ridden farm in the county, which may have been the reason we
could afford to buy it. Farmers today aged under fifty, can have no idea what
it was like trying to make a living in those circumstances. Looking back, it is
somewhat bizarre that the actions of a Frenchman almost brought to extinction
a mammal introduced to Britain a thousand years before by the Normans.
We were left for a few years with skeletal remains scattered around the farm,
burrows falling in and becoming overgrown, and sad looking buzzards suddenly
appearing on telephone poles looking out for beetles or following the plough
competing with rooks and seagulls for earthworms. Eventually, here and there,
apparently immune rabbits reappeared. To begin with, we were worried that
numbers would return to their original level, but we have unexpectedly been
left with the best of both worlds. It seems that the myxomatosis virus mutates
from time to time, enough to act as a natural regulator, allowing us the pleasure
of seeing rabbits around the farm without having to waste time or money trying
to keep them out of crops and new plantations.
However, every time the occasional pathetic myxi rabbit appears, as now,
a feeling of guilt that we inflicted such an appalling disease on them mars the
pleasure. It is certainly true that some farmers were responsible for bringing
406

May 23rd

Signed up as a New Luddite

diseased animals onto uninfected farms, although it quickly became a criminal
offence to do so. And it still bothers me that, if myxomatosis had not reached
this farm naturally, I might also have been tempted to give nature a helping
hand. But at least today, we have enough predators around to dispatch the
sick rabbit I noticed before it becomes completely blind and helpless. I shall be
surprised if I see it again.

May 23rd
Signed up as a New Luddite
I would hate to be called a Luddite. There have been huge technical advances in
farming in my lifetime. Some, like the development of chemical sprays, may have
been welcomed too enthusiastically too soon before the full implications of their
use were properly evaluated, but nothing new has been introduced that I have
long-term doubts about. Food production is increasingly a business governed
by science, rather than a way of life relying on inherited knowledge. It has been
an exciting time that has seen much of the drudgery in agriculture disappear,
with farms no longer depending on family labour to survive, regardless of the
wishes of the next generation.
I am not suggesting that it has all been a bed of roses. There have been
tragic situations where farms have simply been in no position to adjust to a
changing world. And keen young new entrants have found it very difficult to
gain a foothold. We keep hearing about the decline in the number of dairy
farmers, the loss of agricultural workers, the expansion of bigger farms at the
expense of the smaller holdings. But surely farming has always been like that,
since the time of the enclosures and the industrial revolution.
I put our current problems down to the incompetence or apathy of the
politicians of all parties, and, to a lesser extent, with our determination to
avoid marketing cooperatively until it is forced on us. It is only the huge strides
that have been made in farming technology that has kept the industry afloat.
No farmer in his right mind would wish to go back to the “good” old days. It is
only because of the current public demand that so many of us are going over to
organic production. In our case, we have just completed our conversion period
and are now fully organic. We passed our annual inspection a few days ago,
without too much criticism largely because we had been farming extensively
for a number of years, using home grown feed, applying low rates of fertiliser
and only occasionally spraying against weeds like charlock in the corn. Going
organic was really no big deal.
407

2007
We have joined the Soil Association, for no better reason than that they
seem to have the loudest voice in the playground. They are certainly nothing
if not thorough - their inspector was on the farm for seven hours. This was
our third annual inspection, and they must be very aware by now of how we
farm. We have reduced our stocking rate to 45 suckler cows and 50 breeding
ewes with followers on 300 acres, so there is really no incentive to mistreat the
land or the animals. But it seems we must improve our record keeping during
the coming year – we have failed to maintain a detailed daily feeding record
for all our livestock. Since our animals are set stocked at grazing and fed hay
and silage ad. lib. when housed, keeping individual detailed feeding records
is almost impossible. And what purpose would it serve. It is not the farm
inspectors or the staff in the Soil Association office – they could not have been
more helpful. It is some of the nit-picking regulations decided at a higher level
that I find ridiculous.
If I sound less than enthusiastic about reverting to a way of farming that
denies us even the occasional use of artificial chemicals, it is due to the, as
yet, unknown effect that climate change will have on us here. By the end of
April this year, it began to look as if we might be in trouble, with the farm
crying out for rain. The weather has been extraordinarily kind since then, with
grass growing again normally and even the springs and streams flowing faster
than usual. But if the summer had gone on as it began, the lack of an early
application of nitro chalk in March when there was still enough moisture in the
soil to get the grass off to a good start, could have proved disastrous. Nitrogen
from clover is just not available early enough on our land.
There is another way in which farming organically may be possible in very
dry summers, but that is also, and very firmly, denied us. I am referring to
genetic modification. Why are organisations like the Soil Association encouraging the public to resist even properly controlled trials, which is the obvious
way forward with what could be life-saving technology? I look like becoming a
Luddite by association.

Don’t Ask Gordon Out West
As you might expect, with Tony Blair reaching the end of his time in office, the
political pundits are making hay casting aspersions on his Premiership. When
it comes to judging politicians, I am hardly a pundit, agricultural or otherwise,
so perhaps I may be excused for just saying that Blair’s days are over – let them
go. Nothing will be gained from dwelling on his lack of understanding about
matters rural, except to ensure we do a better job with his successor.
It has been suggested that the new Prime Minister should be invited to
visit the West Country to see what farming here is really like. My immediate
reaction to this is one of extreme apprehension. Please don’t let him anywhere
near a farm. If such a visit does take place, it will be along the lines of his
arrival on a beautiful summer’s day in a helicopter, thus avoiding any contact
with the disgraceful condition of our country lanes. DEFRA will have arranged
for him to be shown round some affluent estate, farmed by a fourth generation
Devon farmer, whose grandfather purchased the place from the landlord at the
end of the war, and whose father paid off the mortgage in the 1970s.
Following an inspection of the farm buildings housing huge tractors and
up-to-date farm machinery, a cursory glance at a 19th century range of stone
farm buildings now converted to three or four up-market dwellings, and a stroll
through a placid herd of home-bred pedigree beef cattle, this son of a lowland
Scots Presbyterian minister will sit down to a lunch of prime rib of Devon beef,
locally grown organic veg, homemade ice-cream from a neighbouring dairy farm,
all washed down with a fine red wine from a nearby vineyard.
Then he might feel obliged while out in the sticks to assess the need for a post
office in the nearest village, the main street of which will be obstructed by clean
new parked cars giving the impression that the picturesque thatched houses
are owned mainly by comfortably off commuters or retired urban newcomers.
Gordon Brown will return to Downing Street, convinced we all live off the fat
of the land in secluded 16th century farmhouses looking out over broad green
acres that townsfolk would give their eyeteeth for. He will serve out his term
of office, taking no further interest in agriculture, reinforced in his view that he
was too generous to us during his time as Chancellor. With farmland currently
selling at around £4,000 an acre, supposedly to farmers, it is hardly surprising
that urban politicians assume the industry is crying wolf.
The only way that a visit by the incoming Prime Minister might serve a
useful purpose would be if our present County NFU chairmen, Paul Griffith
and Martin Howlett, were to invite Gordon Brown to attend open meetings
409

2007
of farmers at somewhere like Exeter and Truro Cattle Markets respectively,
without Press or ministry officials present, much as we did with John Major at
Tavistock at the ’97 General Election. This to be followed by a visits to two
or three farms selected by Brian Warren, of Farm Crisis Network and James
Morrish, of Rural Stress South West. I realise this is just a pipe dream.
I am left with the hope that our farm leaders will get to meet Gordon Brown
before he takes over, on his home ground in Downing Street. It is highly likely
that David Miliband, having studiously avoided making any challenge for the
top job in recent weeks, will be rewarded with the offer of a senior cabinet
post. The new Prime Minister must be persuaded to give Miliband another
year at least at DEFRA; he has hardly had time to get to grips with his current
job. The possibility that we may have another Cunningham or Beckett, a
fading heavyweight on the slide, dumped on us - the name Prescott springs
to mind – doesn’t bear thinking about. There is the even greater danger that
responsibility for climate change may be separated from DEFRA, thus removing
the agricultural voice from the Cabinet table.
I admit to feeling sorry for Gordon Brown. I believe that in 1997 he would
have made a better Prime Minister than Blair, but he is now coming to the job
ten years too late. He also has a legacy to safeguard, which is bound to colour
his performance at No 10. I find it hard to accept that he was born the year I
started farming.

Darfur Challenge for Jamie Oliver
I always thought gluttony was one of the seven deadly sins – not as bad as
coveting your neighbour’s wife perhaps, but certainly not something to be encouraged. I am constantly surprised, therefore, at the sheer volume of cookery
programmes we are assailed with on TV these days. I have nothing against
Delia Smith demonstrating how best to boil an egg, but I confess I am getting
a bit fed up, if you’ll excuse the pun, with some of the fancy ways of tarting
up good food that TV chefs seem to take such a delight in. I am just waiting
for the day when one of the guest celebrities on the ‘Ready, Steady, Cook’ programme, asked to give an opinion on tasting a dubious looking mound of this
and that, embellished by what appears to be a trail of pink slime, answers with
the splendid three-letter word ‘yuk’.
It could be argued that we are only being encouraged by all this attention
to food to become gourmets, rather than gluttons, but that doesn’t quite fit
with news items suggesting that as a nation we are becoming very overweight,
410

Jun 6th

Darfur Challenge for Jamie Oliver

or pictures of starving refugees in Darfur. Perhaps I am being a little harsh
in criticising the very people who are demonstrating the merits of buying fresh
local produce. But as farmers, I think we have a right to comment on what is
done with what we grow, particularly as the prices that are charged in some
swank restaurants seem to bear no relation to the prices we are paid for the
ingredients.
I came across an example of this recently in an article about Jamie Oliver’s
Fifteen restaurant near Newquay in Cornwall. I have nothing but praise for
what Jamie has achieved in getting the nation to think more about what is
dished up in schools and hospitals, and this latest venture is obviously doing
wonders for the local economy, but one sentence in the piece took me aback
more than somewhat. It ran “Dinner at Fifteen costs £90 for the taster menu
with wine, or £50 without”. In case we happened to be that way later in the
summer, this seemed worth following up.
Phoning the restaurant, I began with the obvious question – did the price
cover two people? You’ve guessed it – the answer was just one. I queried how
one person manages to get through £40 worth of wine with £50 worth of food.
The charming girl at the end of the line explained that it is a six-course meal
with a wine professionally selected to match each course. I confess I didn’t have
the nerve to ask if one could forgo the house wines and take along a bottle of
plonk. I was advised to book well in advance and, if my lottery numbers come
up, I may be tempted, but I take off my hat to Jamie Oliver for persuading
70,000 people to visit Fifteen in its first year, thus helping to further the training
of young would-be chefs.
Don’t get me wrong - I enjoy good food as much as the next man, but
not at these prices. I get the most pleasure, when we are eating out, in finding
somewhere that is unexpectedly exceptional, with menu prices no more than average. We have sometimes come across places like that in Devon and Cornwall,
although sadly when returning years later, we often find the chef has changed
and the food as well.
Two of the most memorable meals I can recall occurred in France years ago
when we were energetic enough to meander through Europe by car occasionally
for a short holiday. One was at a truckers’ cafe in the Dordogne, sitting on
benches at a trestle table in the open air. The other at the grottiest lodging
house imaginable somewhere south of Paris, when we were belatedly looking for
a bed for the night. We asked the proprietor in his kitchen, stirring something
in a saucepan with a fag dangling from his lower lip, if there was any chance of
an evening meal. I was horribly afraid that in answering, the ash would fall into
the food, but the supper, served in a spotless dining room, was ‘merveilleuse’ !
411

2007
I wonder if the price of the meal at Fifteen was raised to £100, whether it
would deter any of the would-be diners. That extra £10 could feed a child in
Darfur for weeks, if not months. Perhaps that is Jamie Oliver’s next crusade?

June 13th
Sort Out Diseases Gordon
I see that the European Commission is considering the reintroduction of meat
and bone meal into pig and poultry rations. Not unnaturally, those of us who
have been involved in beef production through the long years since the BSE
crisis first arose in 1986, are extremely nervous of any relaxation of the very
stringent precautions that have been in place since then. Nor can the families
of the tragic cases of vCJD view the possibility, however remote, of any one
else having to suffer the trauma of this heart-rending disease without grave
misgivings.
I know that BSE appears to be dying out, with only the occasional instance
in older cows, which are, in any event, all incinerated when they reach the end
of their lives. It is also true that there have been no new cases of vCJD so far
this year, the longest period without a case since the disease first occurred in
1996. But today, after all these years and a great deal of scientific research, the
exact origin of BSE remains conjecture. And we still do not know how, or even
if, it is actually transmitted to people as vCJD. So why, before a set period of
years has passed without any new cases of BSE or vCJD showing up, do we
dare contemplate relaxing our vigilance? The answer is all down to trying to
save public money.
It was trying to save money that probably caused the rapid spread of BSE
in the first place. Thanks to a shortfall in the supply of soya bean meal (the
main protein constituent of dairy cow rations) due to drought in the US in the
1970s, the animal feed companies persuaded the then Conservative Government
to allow this to be substantially replaced with meat and bone meal, in order to
keep down the cost of milk to the public. To facilitate the increased use of this
material, the age-old sterilisation process was streamlined and ten years later,
we had BSE. The Germans at that time continued using the old system and
they remained free of the disease.
The cost to the Exchequer and farmers has been immense. Over the years,
well over eight million healthy cows have been incinerated as a precautionary
measure instead of entering the food chain, with government compensation set
at little more than half their value. Today, the actual price for beef paid to the
farmer, although it is slowly recovering, is still ten per cent below what it was
412

Jun 20th

Delight at Fledging Owl Flight

20 years ago. That cannot be sustained much longer, and any wobble in public
confidence is the last thing we need.
There have always been outbreaks of livestock plagues from time to time –
it is part and parcel of farming. I have no doubt BSE will eventually follow
the others into agricultural history, although the basic precautions will remain
standard abattoir practice. What is worrying, however, is the current frequency
with which one disease outbreak follows another. No sooner was BSE brought
under control, than we had a run away outbreak of ‘Foot and mouth’ disease,
immediately followed by rampant bovine TB, from which we are still suffering. Even a serious case of avian flu managed to reach these shores, although
thankfully restricted to the one location.
It would probably be unfair to blame Ministry veterinary officials for BSE
– very little was understood about prion diseases in animals, and a cheap food
policy was the overriding consideration. But I have no hesitation in blaming
the subsequent disease outbreaks on DEFRA’s Animal Health Division. The
‘Foot and mouth’ outbreak would never have occurred if the swill-processing
farm responsible had been closed down when it was routinely inspected. Bovine
TB would now be under control if weak Animal Health Ministers had the guts
to tackle the job properly. And even the very expensive case of ‘Avian flu’
could have been avoided if ministry officials had enforced their own gold-plated
regulations.
We have a new Prime Minister taking office shortly. He, more than most
politicians, must be aware of the enormous cost to the nation of these disease
outbreaks, but unless we make sure he understands how they came about, he
will probably attempt to pass the buck to farmers or blame Brussels. Perhaps
Gordon Brown will surprise us all and take a real interest in what goes on at
DEFRA. And, better still, realise that rather than getting rid of the CAP, he
could ensure it works properly.

June 20th
Delight at Fledging Owl Flight
I cannot deny that I was very irritated by the recent European Bird Monitoring
Survey about the decline in the numbers of farmland birds. As an old codger,
I should by now be capable of shrugging off the persistent accusations that
we are responsible for ‘environmental degradation’ that is given as the cause,
implying that farmers are wrecking the countryside. Thankfully, before my
blood pressure reached danger levels, I read Anthony Gibson’s column in last
week’s WMN farming section, which accurately and fairly puts the whole issue in
413

2007
its proper context. It won’t stop so called ‘bird lovers’ rushing to the defence of
one of the sponsors, the RSPB, but it would be to the credit of that organisation
if it were to reprint Anthony’s article in full in the next edition of their journal.
In fact, I would immediately apply to become a member, although in view of
some of my past comments, that might act as a disincentive.
Apparently it is reckoned that the populations of Europe’s commonest farmland birds have declined by 44 per cent over the last 25 years. Maybe it has no
bearing on that particular statistic, but it did cross my mind to wonder how
close to 44 per cent was the decline in the real value of farm-gate prices over
that same period. As always when this particular criticism is levelled at us, I
wished there was an easy way of demonstrating that, by definition, if farmland
did not exist there would be no farmland birds as such. Many of the bird species
that are defined in that way would only be present in their natural habitat moor, mountain, marsh, heath or forest, and in nothing like the numbers that
we see today.
To our farming ancestors, unless it could be eaten, wildlife was probably
just a nuisance. These days, with such a large proportion of our land area
now farmed, space has to be made for what actually gives most of us so much
pleasure. It is evening as I write, and our young barn owls are newly fledged.
We have seen the parent birds frequently during the last few weeks as they set
off and returned from their vole hunting trips in the nearby hayfields. Tonight,
I am being distracted by the sight of two youngsters flying, one after the other,
past my windows on what are obviously their first attempts to search for their
own prey, and I wouldn’t have it any otherwise. Hopefully in the evenings to
come, there may be more siblings to follow, but for the time being at least,
there is a 100 per cent increase in barn owl numbers on this farm.
To suggest that declines in bird populations are indicators of environmental
degradation, as the RSPB does, is surely nonsense. They merely indicate the
current state of farmland as a manmade habitat for wild birds. We can certainly
adjust it to order, as the increase in cirl buntings in South Devon proves, but
if producing food and possibly fuel become more important in future, we may
be forced to reverse the process. It is the climate that will have the last say.
However all of this went out of my head when I read about the latest research
of the National Audubon Society (Birdlife in the US). It shows that there has
been an extraordinary 80 per cent decline in the US over the last 40 years in the
populations of some of their most popular bird species, particularly those that
regularly visit bird feeders. This seems to me to indicate two things – as usual,
anything we can do, the Americans can do better and, secondly, by continually
414

Bourne’s Mind Closed

supplementing the diet of some of our favourite birds, perhaps we are actually
harming rather than helping them.
I was shocked to learn of the tragic death of Keith Ashelford in a road
accident last Thursday. All of us in the farming community in this part of
North Devon knew Keith well. Aside from his own farming, he ran a livestocktransport service, providing for many of us with cattle and sheep the essential
link between farm and market. He has arrived here on the farm on countless
occasions at the crack of dawn, cheerful and smiling when I have been only
half awake, ready to load up. And always ready to advise us about the current
prices and best outlets for our stock. Our thoughts are with his family at this
very sad time.

June 27th
Bourne’s Mind Closed
We have finally reached the end of a very long and expensive road, which has
led us precisely nowhere. I am referring to the Independent Scientific Group’s
report of its study into the effect of badger culling on the incidence of TB
in cattle. This has taken ten years to complete, cost the taxpayer 50million
pounds, killed 11,000 badgers and told us very little that we did not already
know.
I feel particularly frustrated about this, as I was involved in a small way
with the government’s original decision to undertake the research. As Devon
NFU chairman in 1997, I accompanied Elliot Morley, the Animal Health Minister in the newly elected Labour Government, on a fact-finding tour of some of
the worst TB affected farms in the county. I also attended a meeting held the
following year in Launceston, where Professor John Bourne, the ISG chairman,
outlined how the study was to be conducted. Farmers and members of the
badger protection societies, who were present that evening, will recall how concerned we all were that very little of value was likely to come out of the research
as it was proposed. I managed to get a few words with Professor Bourne after
the meeting about the explosion in badger numbers in the South West and the
possibility that it might interfere with the validity of the trials. He dismissed
my fears and I came away with the impression that he had a closed mind on
the subject.
And so it has turned out. As you might expect, the Badger Trust, which
these days represents the badger protection societies, has welcomed the report’s
conclusion that ‘no practical method of culling badgers can reduce the incidence
of TB to any meaningful extent’. The Badger Trust presumably also accepts,
415

2007
by association with the introductory words to that conclusion, that ‘badgers
contribute significantly to bTB spread in cattle, by as much as 50 per cent in
some areas’. This is something it has always refuted, publicly at least, in the
past, so here is a small step in the right direction.
However, what I cannot understand is how the trials managed to establish
so positively that whatever method of culling was used, the findings would have
been the same. That is merely supposition and not a scientific conclusion, since
all that was tested was live trapping followed by shooting, which resulted at
best in a 70 per cent cull. This was guaranteed to disturb and increase the
stress on already overcrowded badger populations, which is what is causing the
rise in herd breakdowns in the first place. Had Professor Bourne stated that
‘no practical method that was available to the trial’ can reduce the incidence of
TB, I would have some sympathy with his findings, but he must have realised
that nothing less than a 100 per cent cull in the circumstances would prove
anything. The possibility of gassing with cyanide, which was used in extreme
cases to bring TB under control in the 1970s, is quite rightly unacceptable
these days, but why is no mention made of gassing with carbon monoxide from
exhaust fumes, which is surely the most humane way of achieving a meaningful
cull?
I am left with other unanswered questions, of which the most relevant is
how Professor Bourne can pontificate that the best way forward is a substantial
tightening of all the controls that are already strangling cattle farming. That
was not part of his research, and can only be his opinion based on information
about which those of us at the sharp end are only too well aware. What farmers
really want to know is how to bring badger populations down to an acceptable
level if direct culling is not possible.
One of my pet theories about the increase in badger numbers since the
1970s, which is having such a detrimental effect on many other areas of the
countryside, is the widespread cultivation of maize for cattle feed. Since giving
up maize growing fifteen years ago, our badger numbers, which had quadrupled over the previous fifteen years, have been steadily declining and I have no
other explanation. This year the number of occupied setts seems to be down
to almost single figures for the first time since the 1960s, and those that are
occupied are nothing like as active as usual. And before anyone comes to the
obvious conclusion, no, we are not slaughtering badgers, and to the best of my
knowledge, nor are any of our neighbours.

Keep a Weather Eye Open

July 4th
Keep a Weather Eye Open
Writing at the end of April, with the farm drying up fast, I welcomed some
showery weather, adding that I hoped it would go on raining for three more
weeks at least. So now, as we enter July, I have only myself to blame for the
waterlogged fields in one of the wettest summers I can remember. At least we
are spared the flooded farmland we see daily on the news, between pictures
of furniture floating around in people’s living rooms and police grappling with
terrorist car-bombs. Farming in the uplands of North Devon, we have much to
be thankful for, but it would be nice to begin haymaking. The sun is actually
shining for a few minutes, but I will avoid wishing it to continue for the rest
of the month in case I precipitate a heat wave of Greek proportions, where old
folk were dying recently in temperatures in the 40s.
The hay fields are beginning to look distinctly past their best, but at least
the winter oats are benefiting from the extra moisture, and the red clover leys
are fast recovering from silage making. The cattle and sheep are also looking
well considering their backs are hardly ever dry – they seem to prefer this cooler
weather to the heat and flies of a normal summer. The wet weather has brought
on some coughing in a bunch of stores, which appear to be thriving, but which
have almost certainly got a touch of lungworm. It is something we sometimes
get in a wet misty autumn, and is normally treated routinely to prevent any
animal going on to develop pneumonia. But not these days. Now that we are
organic, Jim is obliged to take faeces’ samples to confirm his suspicions, and get
veterinary advice and Soil Association permission before proceeding, by which
time the stores may have developed a natural immunity or be too far on to
make a good recovery.
But I mustn’t grumble. Bev has sold half the lambs, our first organic sales,
at a pretty good price, 25 per cent more than they would otherwise have fetched,
and the remainder are nearly ready to go. One thing that did surprise me was
the fact that the price for organic lamb is a fixed contract price, which has
not changed since it was set in January, unlike the price for standard run-ofthe-mill lamb which varies from week to week according to demand. Although
having a set price makes it easier to market lambs in top condition, I can see
the possibility of the organic price being little different to the standard price
at times of shortage – as must have occurred at this time a year ago. And I
wonder what will happen to the price if more organic lamb becomes available
than is required by the organic buying public.
While on the subject of lamb, I would challenge the recent claim from New
417

2007
Zealand that their lamb production, even allowing for a journey halfway around
the world, makes less of a carbon footprint than UK lamp production. Their
argument seemed to be based on the hypothesis that we always trough-feed our
sheep to make up for poor grass-growth in our colder winters, while they can
grow grass all year round. That may be true in northern Britain, but here in the
southwest most of our sheep manage very well on grass that continues to grow
at least until Christmas, and often, with these warmer winters, right through
until spring. Where are the figures to back up the New Zealand assertion or is
it just a marketing ploy?
Actually, I don’t really want to know. All this talk of CO2 calculators is
a complete red herring. Are we going to end up having to plant a tree for
every lamb we sell, to compensate for the energy used to produce it? Until we
reduce our dependence on fossil fuel really dramatically, nothing will change.
And that is unlikely unless something frightens us into believing that our future
may depend on it. Perhaps this appalling weather is a sign of summers to come,
with the shift in the Gulf Stream already occurring, something that was forecast
as one of the possible outcomes of climate change. But I am not holding my
breath waiting for people to abandon their cars and take to bicycles. Even I
believe that next week the summer will arrive, or perhaps the week after, or
maybe once we get into August.

Blackbird’s Songs for RABI
I can think of no pleasanter way of spending a summer’s evening than sitting
among friends and acquaintances in the garden of some grand old country house
listening to a good concert. And when it has been organised in aid of the charity
closest to the heart of the farming community, there is really no option, whatever
the distance, but to be there.
The event I am referring to on this occasion was an evening of Midsummer
Music held at Dowrich House near Sandford to raise funds for the Royal Agricultural Benevolent Institution. Dowrich House is only a couple of miles as the
crow flies southeast from us, so it should be no great effort to get there. That
is until you remember we live in the heart of the Devon countryside where no
road goes straight to anywhere. We set off driving due west for two miles, which
takes us to the end of our lane. Turning right, we go north, gradually swinging
northeast, for two and a half miles, before turning east bearing southeast for a
further two and half miles. We are now less than a mile across the fields from
where we started. We continue south for another two miles, turn due east for
418

Jul 11th

Blackbird’s Songs for RABI

a quarter of a mile and finally north for the last few hundred yards to arrive at
Dowrich. We have travelled nearly ten miles.
Perhaps we should have walked - it might have been quicker. Actually, if
we had used a pony and trap, it would have been quicker. There is an ancient
highway, which I have often mentioned in this column, which takes us almost
direct to Dowrich. It has recently been designated by a local public enquiry as
a restricted byway closed to mechanically driven vehicles. It is hardly suitable
for cars, although passable for tractors and 4x4s, but in future only open to
walkers, riders, cyclists and horse drawn carts. That is unless you live or farm
along it, in which case you can presumably use anything from a motor scooter
to a Centurion tank. There are still traces today of other old tracks, which
100 years ago when most of the land was part of larger estates, were used as
shortcuts between farms at the discretion of the landlord. We may go at three
times the speed nowadays, but we have to travel three times as far.
But I digress. Arriving at Dowrich House to a warm welcome from the
owners, Michael Lee and his family, with a background of jazz and a promising
waft of hog-roast, we join an audience of over 200 people. Although most are
from around these parts, there are farming friends we see all too rarely from all
over Devon. Our own Rosemary Nash is there, National Chairman of the Board
of Trustees of RABI for the last ten years and who better at the helm through
these difficult times. The charity, founded nearly 150 years ago, has probably
never been in so much demand, providing support and financial assistance worth
£1.5m to over 1,500 farmers, farm workers and their families in 2006. Rosemary
is due to retire this September – it will need someone very special to step into
her shoes.
Unbelievably, although the sky stayed overcast throughout, the evening
passed without a drop of rain. We relaxed, with strawberries and cream and
wine, enjoying music from piano, cello and clarinet, a classical guitarist, and
the Exeter Chamber Choir. At one point as the twilight deepened, a blackbird
flew up to his accustomed place on the topmost ridge of Dowrich roof, his song
merging with that of the choir as he proclaimed his right to the territory. He
sang on through the ensuing applause, until he realised he had seen off the
challenge and after a quick shake and ruffling of feathers, he flew away to a
chimneystack on the far side of the house. His song came floating back to us
as we watched a juggler performing the near impossible, throwing and catching
coloured balls in the almost dark. The evening ended as always with the ‘Last
night of the Proms’.
We set off for home, driving south, as you would expect. The good news
is that since that night a new umbrella organisation has been launched with
419

2007
the support of the NFU Mutual, called the Farming Help Partnership, which
will bring together the work of the three main farming charities – Farm Crisis
Network, ARC-Addington Fund and RABI.

Is Benn the Right Person
It may be my imagination, but I believe that a subtle shift in the long-term
outlook for farming has just occurred. Two recent items of news, some would
say bad news, and both relating to extreme weather conditions, have given me
quiet grounds for optimism.
The first is the warning from the business advisory firm Deloitte that, due to
bad weather last year, reduced harvests worldwide had pushed up grain prices,
leading to the very real possibility of a sustained rise in food prices. That may
not be what people wish to hear, but it is about time the possibility of food
shortages, the only circumstance that puts the price of food at a realistic level,
should be voiced by someone other than farmers. It could incidentally also
reduce the scandalous amount of food that is thrown away. It may bring home
to people the very real danger that climate change might, just might, cause
queuing at the entrance to Tesco, instead of only at the check-outs. And a
bad dream like that is probably the only thing that will disturb the new Prime
Minister’s sleep sufficiently to put food security higher up his agenda.
The other bit of news was the announcement by Hilary Benn, the recently
appointed DEFRA Secretary of State, that following representations from farmers at the Great Yorkshire Show last week, he has, overnight, lifted the European
restriction on using machinery on waterlogged ground, to allow crops to be harvested. He has also allowed us to make use of set-aside for grazing livestock,
where heavy rain has ruined pastures. These decisions may not altogether please
the environmentalists, who see these regulations as necessary curbs on moneygrubbing farmers, but they are certainly a godsend for those of us at the sharp
end of food production. What is really encouraging is the fact that our new
Secretary of State has already attended two agricultural shows, actually talked
to farmers and immediately acted on what they told him.
I know one swallow doesn’t make a summer, but Benn, a vegetarian for the
last 35 years, did ask us to judge him on his actions and not his diet, so perhaps
he has made a good start. However, I confess to having reservations about his
appointment. Although son of that strongly opinionated left-wing politician
Tony Benn, I get the impression that our Hilary tends to go with the flow. For
instance, I know he says he became a vegetarian because of his first wife, reason
420

Jul 25th

CPRE’s Wrong Leader

enough in a newly married twenty year old, but I am curious to know on what
grounds he was converted – healthy eating or sanctity of life? Perhaps it is none
of my business, but seeing that the decisions he makes for the foreseeable future
have a bearing on an industry that is all about eating, it would help to know
where he is coming from.
I also ask myself why Benn was given the DEFRA job in the first place –
his urban background and ministerial experience do not make him the obvious
choice. It is pretty clear that Gordon Brown was determined to start with a
completely new cabinet. Blair and Brown, however contentious their relationship, would surely have discussed senior ministerial appointments to ensure a
smooth handover of power. It possibly explains why David Miliband, promised
the post of Foreign Secretary provided he didn’t rock the boat in any leadership
election, replaced Margaret Beckett as Environment Secretary to see out Blair’s
premiership. Blair could then move Beckett into the foreign office to keep the
seat warm for Miliband. After the single farm payment fiasco, he could hardly
sack her without admitting serious ministerial misjudgement on his own part.
Let Brown get rid of her when the time came, allowing the onetime leader of the
Labour Party but worst agriculture minister we ever had, slide unnoticed into
obscurity. Perhaps I am being unduly cynical but it seems the only reasonable
explanation for Beckett’s extraordinary promotion.
It also confirms my opinion that ministerial appointments are little more
than a game of musical chairs round the Cabinet Table. Qualifications for
the job seem relatively unimportant. Hopefully, Hilary Benn’s appointment
was more than just an acknowledgement of his recent challenge for the deputy
leadership of the labour party. We badly need someone tough enough to stand
up against Gordon Brown’s obvious distaste for all things agricultural, but with
changes to European farm policies approaching, is Benn that person?

July 25th
CPRE’s Wrong Leader
The Campaign for the Protection of Rural England is in grave danger of making
itself a national laughing stock. It has just elected Bill Bryson, that popular
and often hilarious travel writer, as its new president. Let me hasten to say
that I have nothing against Mr Bryson - I thoroughly enjoy reading his books.
Although an American, he has lived here, off and on, for the past 30 years.
Getting to know our rural landscape for the first time as an adult, he is perhaps
better qualified to appreciate it than we who have absorbed it gradually from
childhood.
421

2007
In researching his book, Notes from a Small Island, in 1994, he probably
saw more of the UK than many of us do in a lifetime. In the course of his
wandering, he actually went by train from Exeter to Barnstaple on the Tarka
line, but was unable to find a bus on to Minehead. He returned hurriedly to
Exeter the same day, to avoid, as he put it, spending the night in Barnstaple
with folk talking in that quaint ‘Oi be drinking zoider’ accent of this part of
the world. A shame, although the experience does not seem to have soured his
view of our ‘lush Devon countryside – gorgeous and extravagantly green’, which
is very much the same now as it was when he passed so close to us.
So why do I think Bill Bryson so unsuited to the role of president of the
CPRE as to bring that worthy organization into disrepute, even ridicule? Addressing its annual meeting, he suggests that the whole of England should be
made a National Park. I don’t disagree for one minute with his opinion that
he knows of no landscape that is ‘more artfully worked, more lovely to behold,
more comfortable to be in, than the countryside of England’. He points out
that where he comes from, when the landscape is stunning it’s because nature
made it that way. Here, when it’s stunning, it is because people made it that
way. He goes on to suggest that ‘creating an enchanting landscape is only part
of the achievement – keeping it is the real trick’.
But nowhere in his 2,000-word speech does he make it clear that farmers are
the people who originally created virtually all of this enchanting countryside.
The word farm is barely mentioned, which is where I fall out with him. He
admits that in Iowa, you would be thought mad to spend a day walking across
farmland. I am not surprised. As we wandered by rail across the US five years
ago, we happened to pass very close to Des Moines in Iowa, where he was
born and brought up. Its unvarying hedge-less scenery viewed from our train
window was probably the most boring part of our American trip. I believe Iowa
is known as the tall-corn state, but with the US in the grip of a severe drought
at the time, the corn or maize as we call it, was barely high enough to reach an
elephant’s knee.
It is not surprising, therefore, that Bill Bryson’s delight in the English landscape centers on the abundance of our hedgerows. But he is really worried that
everywhere they are just quietly fading away. He says that hedgerows die bit by
bit, so that eventually you end up with no hedgerows at all – and this is the fate
that awaits very large swathes of the countryside. What complete tosh. Doesn’t
he know that hedgerows are protected by law – their removal is practically a
hanging offence - with strict regulations governing their maintenance?
The fact that Iowa, with a population of only three million, covers an area
larger than England may partly explain it, but the existence of barbed wire
422

Aug 1st

Still Time to Escape Disaster

when Iowa was originally settled in the 1830s is the real difference. Had barbed
wire been available when our farmland was enclosed a hundred years before
that to feed an exploding population, our countryside would look very different
today. Farmers originally invented hedges as the only way to keep our animals
in and the wildlife out.
Bill Bryson need have no fear that our hedgerows will disappear. We appreciate the look of our countryside more than he does – we made it. What we
don’t need, as he suggests, is ‘an aggressively pro-active policy by somebody
to identify the neediest hedgerows’. All farmers need is for people to pay the
proper price for the food grown in the fields that hedges protect.

August 1st
Still Time to Escape Disaster
Has the fine weather really arrived at last, or is this just a short interlude before
more rain sets in? If we do get a hot and sunny August, it is still possible the
year may not be a total disaster.
The livestock have certainly not been short of available grazing, having for
once trodden in more grass than they have eaten. Jim is intending to get the
hay making under way at last, although some of the tangled and over-mature
hay fields will only be an expensive salvage job. A second cut of red clover
silage and a reasonable corn harvest and we may yet go into the winter with
reasonable stocks of fodder. That is if the weather gives us half a chance, and,
more importantly, if the local farm contractors, who must have been kicking
their heels for most of the summer, can keep up with the sudden demand.
Farmers further up country have fared much worse, with whole fields under
water, crops written off and in some cases animals drowned.
So far, this has been nowhere near the worst farming year I have experienced.
The blizzard year of 1963 and the summer drought of 1976 will take a lot of
beating as contenders for that dubious honour.
In 1963, it was not the length of time we were snowed in that was the real
problem, difficult as it was to get the farm chores done and the milk delivered
by tractor and trailer to the milk factory six miles away, once we had dug our
way out. Mains electricity had just been connected but we did not have mains
water for another four or five years. The dairy herd was dependant on springs
for their water supply in the cattle yards in winter and this froze up completely.
We were obliged to let the cows run out in the snow-covered front meadow to
drink from the stream. As the winter progressed, the stream also froze and
we were perpetually breaking the ice to let them get at the water, but they
423

2007
became very reluctant to approach the edge and persisted in eating snow to
quench their thirst. As you can imagine, the milk yields plummeted. With
an autumn calving Channel Islands herd, the higher milk price in the winter
months was our main source of income. Nor did the milk yields recover when
spring eventually arrived – the entrance to our lane remaining a ‘Cresta Run’
between packed snowdrifts until early May.
1976 was quite the opposite, but just as disastrous. We had mains water by
this time, which got over any drinking problem, but there was almost nothing
for the cows to eat. The streams that bounded the farm dried up completely,
so much so that some large trees on the banks, which had experienced nothing
like it in their 200 years existence, being shallow rooted, gave up and died. As
did much of the grass ground, turning into coconut matting, and also the corn
fields, yielding little more than three or four hundredweight of barley and a few
small bales of straw per acre.
We survived, but these were isolated years in a farming lifetime. I can
even remember the 1947 floods, quoted by the media as the last occasion that
rivers burst their banks to the extent they have this year. However that was
not caused by continuous wet summer weather, but by intermittent snowfalls
through January and February, building up at below freezing temperatures,
which all thawed simultaneously following two days of warm heavy rain in mid
March. I was working on a farm in Surrey at the time, and spent the whole
of that winter in a Dutch barn forking loose hay to an old boy using a hand
operated hay press. We had to bale up enough hay to supply a small lorry with
a load twice a week to be taken up to the London area, mainly for horse feed.
The farmer told me it was the best year he could remember, the price of hay
having risen substantially, due to the shortage of available hay from the eastern
counties.
All these events were unpredictable and occurred many years apart. We are
warned to expect frequent extremes of weather as a result of climate change,
and I don’t doubt that farming will adapt to them. Our weather has always
been changeable, but contending with sudden unseasonable extremes may prove
more difficult.

Revealing FMD’s Disaster

August 8th
Revealing FMD’s Disaster
My first reaction to the news last Saturday morning that an outbreak of Foot
and Mouth had been discovered on a farm in Surrey was one of complete horror.
In fact, for a few seconds as I turned on the early TV news, I thought I must
be watching a scenario of what might happen if the FMD virus were to escape
from an animal research laboratory. There was no mention of Pirbright at that
stage, but knowing the area well from my schooldays, it is hardly surprising
that the possibility immediately occurred to me. I don’t doubt that livestock
farmers in the district have been aware they were sitting on a time bomb ever
since DEFRA admitted, following the last FMD outbreak six years ago, that
the Pirbright laboratories were in a very shabby state and urgently needed
upgrading.
As I write, it has not been confirmed that the Animal Health Institute or
the adjacent pharmaceutical company, Merial, is the source of the infection.
However, if it is announced that, because no lapse in the security arrangements
at the site can be found, DEFRA is considering the possibility that a migrating
duck may have introduced the infection, there is not a farmer in the land who
will believe a word of it.
In recent years, particularly where animal health is concerned, we have been
badly let down by senior civil servants. Surely the top official at the Animal
Health Division, possibly even Dr Reynolds herself, should have demanded that
Pirbright be properly funded and the buildings brought up to date. When was
the last time the head of a ministry department took responsibility and resigned
over a divisional cock-up - there have been plenty to choose from? I know the
chief executive of the Rural Payments Agency got the sack over the Single Farm
Payments fiasco, but I have never discovered whether he was fired for failing to
deliver the impossible, or if he was given the push for not having the guts to
tell his boss that it was impossible.
Two things arise out of the immediate situation. If it is discovered from
the identity of the virus exactly where this outbreak originated, which seems
to be so important to DEFRA, when are we going to be told where the 2001
outbreak originated? The identity of that virus is surely known, but I don’t
recall any announcement about its origin - South America or Africa or, dare I
say it, Pirbright perhaps? And secondly, if it is decided to activate a vaccination
programme, as now appears on the cards, will DEFRA please make it absolutely
clear to everyone whether this will be a case of ‘vaccinate to live’, or ‘vaccinate
to kill at some later date, when the disease is under control’. This was not
425

2007
made clear last time round, when farmers were well aware that it was only a
temporary reprieve for our animals, while the general public believe to this day
that it was to vaccinate animals to live out their normal lifespan.
Meanwhile, farmers, as usual, are left struggling to cope with the clampdown
that has inevitably been imposed on us. Counting the cost will come later, but
at present just managing our cattle and sheep is a big enough headache. Like
many other farmers, we have a bunch of lambs and eight fat cattle that were
booked in for slaughter on the Tuesday of this week. How long they will be
delayed and how we shall get them back into the inevitable queue remains to
be seen. The same thing happened six years ago, and it was weeks before they
left the farm that time.
We have a road running down the middle of our farm, with most of our cattle
and all our sheep on the wrong side from our buildings. Since none of them
are dairy cows in milk, if we need to get them in, the regulations as they stand
make it illegal for them to cross the road, on pain of a hefty fine or even a spell
in prison. Hopefully this draconian measure will be relaxed quickly. Naturally,
for the sake of the tourist industry, I am glad the public has been given full
access to the countryside. However, and you may find this hard to believe, last
Saturday afternoon I found a gate left unfastened from the road onto a public
footpath through a field containing fifty cattle. I may yet end up behind bars.

August 15th
Smaller Farms to Suffer
They say a week is a long time in politics – well, it is not as long as a week at the
beginning of a foot and mouth outbreak in livestock farming. Thankfully, the
situation does not look as dire now as it did a week ago and it is possible that
the spread of the disease has been halted. But although we are over a hundred
miles away from where it happened, we still seem to be severely restricted in
the day-to-day management of our animals.
For example, as time passes it becomes increasingly difficult to avoid taking
cattle or sheep across a road to fresh grazing. I would guess that most farms in
Devon and Cornwall are bisected at some point by a public road of one sort or
another. Every farmer in the country must have heard on the radio or TV that
under the FMD restrictions only milking cows are allowed to cross a road. This
means that cattle on some dairy farms have been legally crossing the road, back
and forth, twice a day for the last ten days. If you have needed to move your
beef cows just once during that time (after all, they are producing milk for their
426

Aug 15th

Smaller Farms to Suffer

calves and may have been due for a move when the crisis began) – tough, they
must stay where they are. Some cows are obviously more equal than others.
Of course it might be tempting to take a chance and pop them across quickly,
cleaning and disinfecting the road exactly as if they were dairy cows. Crossing
once in the ten days during which dairy cows have crossed forty times, is hardly
adding to any risk. But hold on, you are laying yourself open to criminal
charges, punishable by up to six months in jail or a £5,000 fine. It is very
doubtful that the authorities would actually go that far, but ignorance of the
law would be no excuse. Unfortunately, unless you use the Internet, and there
are plenty of farmers who do not (broadband is still unavailable on many farms,
ours included), there is no certainty that you are aware of this. We have had
nothing in writing from DEFRA since the outbreak started, which is strange
after the hundreds of pages of pamphlets and manuals we have received during
the last five years.
Meanwhile, it was reported in the Sunday Telegraph that 100 empty chemical barrels were removed, without being decontaminated, from Merial, the
vaccine-producing company at Pirbright, by a senior employee, Duncan Fawthrop,
for use on his allotment. A stream running past the allotment continues on
through the farms that were hit by the virus, and is the only drinking water
available to their cattle. That looks pretty conclusive to me as the source of
the outbreak, there are even pictures of the barrels scattered around his allotment, but Mr Fawthrop is not willing to comment. The evidence may be only
circumstantial, but surely he is taking an infinitely greater risk of spreading
FMD than a farmer crossing the road with some cattle. Is Mr Fawthrop liable
to criminal proceedings and a jail sentence? I’ll bet he is not.
As usual, at times like this, it is always the smaller farms that seem to
suffer most from the regulations that are imposed on us. It happened before
and it is happening again. The rules have just been relaxed to allow us to get
animals away for slaughter, but only direct to an abattoir from one farm at
a time. That’s fine for the larger farms which can usually fill a cattle lorry,
but useless for someone with only a few animals to market at any one time.
And it is the smaller family farms, the backbone of rural Britain, often more
vulnerable financially but acting as the lower rungs of the farming ladder, that
need at least an equal opportunity to get through this crisis. What they do not
deserve, and what seems to be all they are getting just now, is the outrageous
advice from the government and the farming organisations that if they are in
difficulties, they should go cap in hand to the farming charities. Like hell they
should. When the time comes to count the cost, if it turns out that Merial
UK was responsible for the outbreak, it is not farms with the biggest claims
427

2007
that should come first, but those that are least likely to survive without proper
compensation.

August 22nd
History of Our Buildings
We have a rather imposing old farm building that has always puzzled me. Horseengine houses or roundhouses, as they are commonly called, can be still found
on many Westcountry farms. They were built against the old threshing barns,
often unobtrusively at the back, to provide the motive power for the threshing
machines, which replaced hand flail threshing from early in the 19th century.
Redundant for the past hundred years, many sadly are mouldering away, too
small or misshapen for much use except as a store or tool shed.
Our roundhouse is, by contrast, neither shy nor retiring. It was built onto
the front of our threshing barn, almost obstructing the earliest approach road
to the farmhouse. It is not even round, but square – 30ft by 30ft, which is as
large as they come. It originally had a heavy slate roof, with the ridge only
a few inches below the ridge of the barn. The whole thing is resting on eight
granite pillars, each over a foot square and standing seven or eight feet above
ground and going down I don’t know how far below. The massive beam that
once supported the large diameter crown wheel was still in place when I first
came to the farm. It must have been the best part of an elm tree, 35ft long
by over 2ft square, with one end resting on a pier built of stone and the other
slotted into the barn wall.
Why our rather small 130-acre hilly Devon farm merited such a grand roundhouse I have never understood. In the early days I never gave it much thought,
apart from marvelling at the work that must have gone into its building. It
had obviously not been used after 1930 as an engine house, when a 4 HP Lister
diesel was tacked onto the opposite side of the threshing barn in a cramped little
corrugate-iron shelter, and connected to the overhead shafting that powered the
barn machinery. The roundhouse appeared to have been converted initially to
house cattle, with mangers and tie-ups for half a dozen cows or fattening bullocks, and the walls enclosed with wooden shuttering, but by the time I arrived
in 1951, it was being used for pigs.
For our first ten years, we stored fertilizer in it on one side of the beam,
which restricted the headroom somewhat, and turned the other half into a
tractor shed and fuel store. It had certainly come down in the world, but the
roof was much too good to waste. Then in the early 1960s, the roundhouse
came back into its own as the most important building on the farm. Our dairy
428

Aug 22nd

History of Our Buildings

herd had outgrown our rather primitive shippon, an old cob building converted
to hold eleven cows, 200yards up the road from the farm, in which we were
milking twenty or so cows on a laborious shift basis. We decided to get up to
date and install a six-abreast milking parlour in the roundhouse. Down came
the wooden shuttering, out went the beam (with some difficulty), and briefly it
looked as it must have done when first built, a great heavy roof balancing seven
foot high on eight slender standing stones, giving the horses all the air they
needed as they walked round driving the thresher. I believe the horse-engine
was considered cruel – ‘a machine for killing horses’, but it replaced the endless
manual labour of threshing with a flail.
It made a very good milking parlour, with solid walls inside the line of the
granite pillars, which remain supporting the roof. There was space for a flooredin loft, with metal bins to supply cow concentrates to the hoppers below. We
eventually milked eighty cows through it and it became the focus of the wide
span cattle yards and silage pit that evolved on the open ground beside it, a
space presumably once used as a rick yard.
Since we gave up dairy farming twenty years ago, the building has become a
farm workshop, and to visiting strangers it is obviously an old milking parlour
that has seen better days. I doubt if many realise its original purpose. But
thanks to this dreadful summer, I think I may at last have solved why it was
built in the first place. We are still waiting to cut half our hay fields, and some
may well end up being grazed by the cattle. Out of curiosity, I got out the
old 1842 tithe map of the farm, reproduced by my daughter as a school project
many years ago, which lies rolled up with all the farm maps we need for DEFRA
nowadays. I wanted to see how many acres of the farm would have been cut for
hay all those years ago. I have never bothered to tot up the acreages before,
and discovered to my astonishment that of the original 130 acres, only twelve
were meadow and pasture, and these on the low-lying wetter ground. Eighty
acres were classed as arable, with a couple of acres of cider orchards and the
remainder woodland or furze.
Through the golden age of farming in the mid-nineteenth century, this had
never been a small livestock farm, as I had imagined, but had grown corn for
sale, with just enough grass-ground to feed the three or four horses, for which
there was stabling at the lower end of the old farmhouse. It explained the lack
of buildings for cattle, and the splendid, for those days, buildings for arable
farming.

429

2007

August 29th
“Slurry Sunday”
It seems highly likely there will soon be a new day in the farming calendar,
conceivably called ‘slurry Sunday’. That is the opinion of a friend of mine, a
retired dairy farmer, with considerable experience of the problems associated
with that bugbear of modern milk production – the storage and disposal of
slurry. We were discussing the latest proposals to come out of DEFRA, which
will impose even more draconian controls on how, when and where we can utilise
farm yard manure, something that like money, has to be spread around to be
of any value. It looks like a panic response to threats from Brussels, to impose
fines on England for failing to lower sufficiently the nitrate levels in our streams
and rivers.
I shan’t bore you with the details; they have been widely reported in the
farming press since DEFRA’s announcement a week ago. There is one aspect
of them, however, that does impinge on a wider audience and I feel should be
brought to public attention. It is apparently intended that the closed season
for spreading organic manure, as they so delicately put it, should be extended
to almost six months, to avoid the possibility of run-off during the winter when
nothing is growing to absorb it. Presumably DEFRA will then decide in advance
at what date spring will have sprung – the third Sunday in March shall we say
– after which dairy farmers will be at liberty to begin emptying their, by that
time, almost overflowing slurry storage tanks. And begin they obviously will,
probably all on the same day.
Just when we are all starting to notice those first redolent scents of spring, of
primroses, wild violets and bluebells, the air will be filled with the horrendous
pong of stale cow-slurry. The ambience of the English countryside will suddenly
be reminiscent of the stink that hits you, even with the car or coach windows
shut, as you cross the border into Belgium on your way to more salubrious
areas of Europe, or the smell that is always the first thing you notice as you
exit your plane at Brussels airport. Maybe that is what this is all about. The
good burghers of Brussels are fed up with having the reputation of living in
the most malodorous city in the EU, although from my one experience, Venice
must run it a close second. But whether it is caused by inadequate city drains,
or intensive pig farming in the Belgium countryside, I see no reason why we
should be hustled into joining the club by getting a reputation for smelling like
a cowshed for two or three weeks every spring.
I am not for one minute blaming dairy farmers – huge slurry tanks are a
direct consequence of cheap milk, much larger dairy herds and the invention
430

Sep 5th

Insufficient Straw for Bedding

of cow cubicles. Thankfully, in our own dairy farming days, we never quite
reached that level – most of the slurry from our cows could be accommodated
on a heap of gently rotting dung from the previous year, where it gave off the
less obnoxious whiff of ammonia, reminiscent of the midden in an old fashioned
farmyard. I was never very keen on arable farming, but the smell of cow slurry
is probably the one thing that might have put me off livestock farming, had it
been around when I began my career.
Why is DEFRA proposing such an inflexible regulation in such a hurry to
cover every size and type of farm? The deadline for responses is less than three
months away. If they are afraid of Brussels, why don’t they adopt the same
attitude as the French, and ignore paying any fine for as long as possible. We
could then quietly go about the business of adjusting the current controls, to
correct where they are failing to have the desired effect.
Here in the Southwest, there have been years when grass has been growing
vigorously from mid January onwards. I recall a year when a neighbour made
good hay in April. Some winters are much drier than the following summer, as
we have just experienced. And as yet there is no certainty about the changes
global warming will make to our weather. How can one regulation hope to
accommodate every region and every season, without resulting in unworkable
and unfair consequences? And possibly an intolerable smell, which will only
alienate an urban public that is at last becoming sympathetic to the problems
of modern food production?

September 5th
Insufficient Straw for Bedding
A complete change in the weather since the middle of August has allowed us to
harvest our oats, get the second cut of red clover silage safely bagged up, and
at last complete our haymaking. Do I detect a touch of St Swithin’s in all this after the most dreadful summer, we are now enjoying a glorious early autumn.
Wonders will never cease – a farmer actually praising the weather. But only
for a moment. We need a lot more of the same to make up for what has gone
before.
At least we now have enough fodder to take the livestock through the winter. However, due to the persistent rain that delayed mowing, the quality is
inevitably poor and may need supplementing with more grain than usual. Hopefully the oats, which were an average crop, will suffice. If we run short, the cost
of buying concentrates, the price of which has shot up in recent months, will
be almost prohibitive. Added to that, we have nowhere near enough straw for
431

2007
bedding. Only a very prolonged and dry autumn can save us from having to
buy what is sure to be expensive straw from upcountry in the New Year. And
we are the lucky ones; we are probably in a far better position than many livestock producers in the region, thanks to the reduction in our stock numbers as
we gradually feel our way into farming organically.
With the foot-and-mouth outbreak adding to the general malaise, there
has been the inevitable concerted outcry in the farming press, demanding that
retailers and processors pay more for meat, milk and eggs or face the total
collapse of the livestock industry. And, surprise surprise, the supermarkets
have replied by pointing out that they are, as usual, currently engaged in a
vicious price war, and that we should do what they have had to do – get bigger
and become more efficient. To be fair, there is no logical reason for them to
say anything else. They are not responsible for the welfare of farmers or the
countryside; they are multinational food-retailing businesses, obviously much
loved by their shareholders and the great British public. It always puzzles me
why we keep appealing to their munificence – that is something that is simply
not in their nature. It is about as useless as asking a grizzly bear for help when
lost in the forest.
So where do we go from here? We can forget the government – Gordon
Brown has enough on his plate just now and is no doubt feeling pleased with
the swift resolution of the FMD crisis, for which he will give himself most of
the credit, conveniently forgetting that it was almost certainly caused by lax
biosecurity at his own government controlled veterinary health establishment.
Nor do I think it would be any use appealing to the W.I. to ride to the
rescue, as it did over milk prices. Prices have certainly risen since then, but at
the risk of making myself unpopular with a redoubtable group of ladies, who
were very successful in gaining public support for dairy farmers, it is the rise
in value of milk constituents world wide, and the drop in production at home
that has actually forced the retailers to raise prices to secure their supply base.
Although I believe there have been one or two attempts to import fresh milk
from the continent, it is not really a viable option for what is an essential part
of the nation’s diet.
Unfortunately, beef, lamb, pig and poultry products, all of which also have
to be permanently available in every supermarket, are not protected in the same
way. In fact, they are probably the easiest foodstuffs to import from anywhere
in the world. Which is why I am very disappointed in an NFU initiative that
was heralded nine months ago, but about which I have heard nothing since.
Where is the unit that was being set up to monitor the activities of individual
retailers, to expose sharp practice in dealing with suppliers and to ensure the
432

Sep 12th

Irritation Over More Red Tape

public are informed about imports that do not measure up to our exacting
standards? Was the idea stillborn or has the NFU chickened out? I cannot
believe that every supermarket chain is squeaky clean.
Challenging the multinationals en-bloc is a pointless exercise, but confronting
them individually, where their reputations and good names, their most valuable
assets, are at risk is something we should have done years ago.

September 12th
Irritation Over More Red Tape
It is strange how some small incident from early childhood remains indelibly
stamped on the memory whatever else is forgotten as the years go by. In my
case, whenever I see the caterpillar of the garden tiger moth, that large hairy
caterpillar commonly known as a “woolly bear”, I am immediately taken back
to the day when, as a three or four year-old, I attempted to pick one up and was
quickly told not to touch it as it could give me a rash. I have never discovered
whether that was true or not, but to this day, if I see a “woolly bear” crossing
the road looking for somewhere to pupate, I avoid touching it and find a suitable
leaf to move it to safety. Now, if I saw a small child about to pick one up, I
would also tell them to leave it alone, not that it might cause a rash but because
to do so might technically be breaking the law.
I only discovered this when reading the new habitat regulations recently
issued by DEFRA. Under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, two new sites, traditional orchards and ponds, have been added to the list of 63 priority habitats
and three new species, the garden tiger moth, the house sparrow and the grass
snake are now classed with the 1149 species considered to be in decline or under
threat. I was aware that house sparrows were having a hard time of it in urban
areas, thanks to the lack of nesting sites on new houses, but I am surprised at
the inclusion of the other two species which I would not immediately think of
as endangered.
We have always had a resident flock of house sparrows on the farm; roughly
how many I have never bothered to count, but I will take note this coming
winter when I throw them a handful of corn, as I always do on starting the
roller mill. Grass snakes have certainly not declined – if anything they have
increased in the last few years. We find them, together with slowworms, under
old galvanised-iron sheets left in odd spots for their benefit, and sometimes
come across a nest of their eggs hidden in the warmth at the edge of a silage or
dung heap. As for garden tigers, like all butterflies and moths, their numbers
vary widely from year to year depending on weather conditions. Admittedly I
433

2007
haven’t seen any this year, but I have certainly seen both the moths and their
caterpillars regularly in the recent past.
With an apparently healthy population of these three species on the farm,
it is therefore a little disconcerting to read that the habitat regulations have
been altered to include a new clause, which makes it an offence to accidentally
damage or destroy their breeding sites or resting places, even if unaware of their
presence, with the police being responsible for enforcement. But since we are
very aware of their presence (the birds, snakes and moths, that is - the police
are rarely seen in the countryside), the regulations now dictate that in future if
we do need to interfere with their habitat, we shall have to apply for a licence.
Which is of course bordering on the ridiculous, if you consider that we are
bound on occasion to disturb the places in the farm buildings where sparrows
live, or the sheets of tin under whose warmth grass snakes raise their body
temperature in early summer. And as for garden tigers, they are a species of
moth, whose caterpillars are unusual in that they feed on the foliage of almost
all varieties of low growing plants, so no matter what we do, we will inevitably
and unknowingly harm their environment.
I realise I am making a mountain out of what is probably just a small
adjustment to the rules designed to protect endangered species from deliberate
interference, but like many farmers, I am constantly irritated by the unceasing
flow of new red tape that interferes with our own habitat. It is small wonder that
we are ourselves fast becoming a disappearing breed. Incidentally, I have noticed
in the last few days that there are absolutely no wasps around, which considering
the amount of windfalls in the orchard and abundance of blackberries this year,
is quite extraordinary. Is there some simple explanation or will wasps join
the list of insects to be cosseted in future? That may not be so popular with
everyone!

September 19th
Which Know-all to Believe?
Maybe I am just getting old, but nothing in life seems certain these days. Whenever someone with apparently impeccable credentials gives an expert opinion
on a topic of vital interest, another equally qualified know-all plunges into the
debate with an entirely conflicting view. I used to find it easy to know whom
to believe, but not now.
Take, for example, the current debate on the use of vaccination to contain
an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. One argument suggests that if there
had been immediate blanket vaccination in the area around the initial outbreak
434

Sep 19th

Which Know-all to Believe?

at Pirbright, we would have been spared the secondary, and even more expensive shut down of the livestock industry. This is countered by the agricultural
economists, who can show that by resorting to vaccines, the resulting closure of
our export markets would cripple beef and sheep farmers far more in the long
run. Who is right? If we are unable to prevent an outbreak from within our own
borders, let alone one from some distant country where the disease is rife, the
Government will inevitably fall back on vaccination the minute the next outbreak occurs. Which is almost criminal considering that the vaccine-producing
facility, alleged to have caused the present disaster, will be the first to profit.
There are plenty more illustrations of this apparent difference in opinion
between the very people who should be able to reach a consensus. For instance:
‘Are wind farms a cost effective way of generating clean electricity’, ‘do biofuels
use more fossil energy in their production than they replace’, or ‘how much
does planting a tree really offset the carbon footprint of someone flying off
on holiday’ ? Questions like these can surely be accurately measured, unlike
the more speculative debate about the safety of nuclear power, the benefits of
genetic modification, or the merits of organic food.
In the hope of finding some answers, I gladly accepted an invitation last week
to a conference organised by ‘Women Working Together in Devon’ entitled the
Future of the British Countryside. WWT is a recent alignment of the Women’s
Food and Farming Union, the Women’s Institute and the Townswomen’s Guild,
and a more formidable force for good in Devon I find it hard to contemplate.
I believe we are the first county where these three organisations have linked
up in this way and I hope other counties follow quickly – our politicians won’t
know what’s hit them. It was an excellent meeting, but there was one speaker,
Henry Fell, whose views on the future of British farming I was anxious to hear
at first hand. Mr Fell is a farmer of my generation, well known for his strongly
held opinions and blunt speaking. He is currently chairman of the Commercial
Farmers’ Group, who are particularly concerned about home food production.
His contribution was as convincing as I had expected; no doubts at all in
his mind about what the future held. And it was not a pretty picture. The
world population, which had risen from three billion to six billion in the last
50 years, would inevitably rise to nine billion by 2050. World food production
would have to utilise every available acre, if we are to avoid poverty, conflict and
migration. Global warming was a natural process, and curbing greenhouse-gas
emissions will make little difference (he condemned wind turbines as ineffectual,
producing as much CO2 in their production as they save in their operation).
Turning nearer home, Henry Fell made a powerful case for self-sufficiency in
indigenous foods, which here in the UK has come down from 85% ten years ago
435

2007
to less than 70% today. We should forget wild flower meadows and poppy filled
cornfields, and embrace all that science can offer in the pursuit of higher yields
- we are already eating genetically modified organisms in half the products we
buy which contain imported soya.
It was all very much what many farmers wish to hear, but I confess I came
away not totally convinced. There is no certainty that world population will
continue to expand at a fixed rate. And if as a nation we are overweight and
waste a third of the food we buy, 70% self-sufficiency could well be a blessing
in disguise.

Lunacy of Livestock Burial Ban
Back in the spring, the remains of a deer lay hidden in the long grass of one
of our pastures. I didn’t discover it until the day after we turned out the store
cattle. I could see them from a distance all clustered together behaving like a
rugby scrum, and fearing the worst, I forced my way through them, expecting
to find a mineral-deficient or blown bullock on the ground, always a worry in the
first few days after turnout. To my surprise, and relief, it was the well-rotted
and stinking carcase of a roe deer buck, an old one judging by the length of its
horns.
Since we have always had a number of roe deer on the farm, and in some
years a few red deer as well, it is not unusual to find a carcase occasionally,
generally hung up in a fence or with an obvious injury. In this case it was too
far-gone to show why it had died, so perhaps it was just old age. I was certainly
not going to lose any sleep over it, but I found myself trying to disperse the
cattle to allow nature to continue the job of disposing of what was left. It proved
more difficult than I had expected, and I gave up, assuming their curiosity would
soon fade.
The following day, the cattle were still showing an interest, and the ground
had been trodden to a pulp in the vicinity of the dead deer. I stood for some
time and watched from a distance, and although the cattle had the run of three
fields, they all returned at intervals to the spot and appeared to be actually
chewing at what was pretty objectionable material. On closer inspection, the
remains had been scattered about, with little left other than bones and hide.
It is possible that foxes or badgers had been involved overnight, but from the
behaviour of the cattle, I doubt they would have stood much chance of getting a
share, and, in any case, why wait so long to carry out their role as scavengers?
I have often noticed cattle take a passing sniff at a dead animal, sometimes
436

Sep 26th

Lunacy of Livestock Burial Ban

chewing a dry bone from some long dead skeleton, but this was the first time I
had observed them apparently eating decaying flesh. Within a matter of days,
with constant attention from the cattle, all that remained was a skull, two or
three vertebrae and the hooves.
In the light of the present FMD outbreak and the first reported cases of
Bluetongue, both of which can certainly infect deer, it would seem wise in
future to dispose of any deer carcase that the cattle can get at. But what are
we supposed to do with it? No one is likely to pay the local knacker twenty
or more pounds to remove it for incineration. Obviously the simple answer is
to get a shovel and put it underground, but if it is illegal to bury a sheep, I
presume it is also illegal to bury a deer.
This carcase disposal nonsense has now gone quite far enough. When it was
first introduced, there was concern, quite correctly, that the BSE-causing-prion,
seemingly indestructible, could be a future hazard in much the same way that
anthrax spores have always been regarded. But we are virtually through the
BSE nightmare, the only threat left being from the few older cattle which may
once have been fed meat and bone meal, and which will certainly be incinerated
at the end of their lives. There was a worry that sheep could have contracted
BSE, but no actual case has ever been found. Surely, therefore, we must review
the way in which we deal with fallen stock.
The cost to the livestock industry of incinerating every casualty animal can
no longer be justified. We are also paying for the disposal by incineration of
the waste material, at least a third by weight, of every animal that enters the
food chain. Aside from economic considerations, sending all this material up
in smoke is hardly benefiting global warming. It used to have a value, if only
as an organic fertiliser, and it could be used that way again in newly planted
woodland if not on land producing food. If Brussels is the problem, Portugal
has apparently totally ignored the regulation, and I can’t believe that Poland,
on joining the EU, has suddenly stopped dumping all its abattoir waste straight
into carp lakes. It is high time we at least reverted to burying the occasional
smaller casualties on farm.

Daft Ideas From DEFRA
When it comes to dealing with an outbreak of a virulent and contagious animal disease, I reckon I have now heard everything. DEFRA, in its wisdom,
has decided that since a suitable vaccine is not immediately available against
Bluetongue, the latest devastating disease to reach us from Europe, attempts
will instead be made to control the midges responsible for spreading the virus.
This will be done by trapping the midges in large sticky nets, with all ruminant
farm animals susceptible to infection housed from mid-afternoon until after dark
when the midges are at their most active.
My mind boggles. On reading this, I had an immediate mental picture of
Captain Mainwaring organising his ‘Dads Army’ platoon spaced out along the
foreshore, clutching a line of sticky netting to repel the invading hordes from
crossing the North Sea. As for a curfew on cows and sheep during the twilight
hours, will ministry officials be patrolling the countryside with rifles at the
ready? Of course I am being ridiculous, but surely so is DEFRA.
I can only assume that whoever dreamed this up, must have been present
when the first case of Bluetongue was diagnosed on a ‘Rare Breeds’ farm. The
livestock there are probably kept in small paddocks with a convenient shed for
shelter. The proposal might work in those circumstances – sticky netting and
all. It may even have some relevance in large intensive farms where animals are
normally housed all the year round and zero-grazed. But how can extensive beef
and sheep farms, like ours, begin to operate such a scheme? From mid-June
onwards, when midges normally hatch, our cattle are grazing pastures at the
furthest corners of the farm. And our sheep are only ever housed for a couple
of weeks at night during lambing, when there are no midges around anyway.
For sheep farmers on hill, moorland and mountain such an idea is preposterous,
and these are the very farmers who stand to lose most if Bluetongue becomes
permanently established in Britain.
Farmers have had to contend with plagues afflicting their livestock since
time immemorial. Early in the 19th century a policy of wholesale slaughter was
introduced to try and achieve some form of control. It proved very effective,
and over the next 100 years half a dozen endemic diseases including Rinderpest,
bovine Pleuropneumonia and sheep pox were eradicated. Being an island, a
slaughter policy also prevented diseases introduced from abroad, like foot and
mouth, swine fever and fowl pest, from becoming endemic.
However more recently, there have been enormous advances in disease control
with the use of vaccination. Since I started farming, we have virtually eradi438

Oct 24th

Traffic Queuing Blues

cated contagious abortion in cattle, a onetime blight on dairy farming with an
accompanying undulant fever affecting many vets. We currently vaccinate all
our cattle against quarter evil, a clostridial infection like tetanus, which regularly used to kill one or two bullocks a year. There are many other examples of
diseases that we can never eradicate, but which are kept in check these days by
farmer-administered vaccines. Bluetongue will inevitably fall into this category.
Until a suitable vaccine is available, DEFRA must do more than just hope
a cold winter will kill off the midge population. For a start Merial, the vaccineproducing laboratory at Pirbright, currently at a standstill due to its involvement in the foot and mouth outbreak, should immediately resume work developing a Bluetongue vaccine. Since this particular virus can only be transferred
from one animal to another by a midge, there is absolutely no danger to animal
health from leaking drains, contractors’ lorries or other undetected shortcomings at the facility.
Secondly, DEFRA must continue to slaughter, pay compensation and dispose of every animal that develops Bluetongue in the coming months, and more
importantly, blood test herds and flocks where the disease is suspected, to eradicate the carriers that will inevitably occur. This will minimise the reinfection to
our own midges when they hatch out next summer. By declaring an outbreak,
DEFRA has avoided the legal obligation to do this, leaving farmers to slaughter and dispose of diseased animals at their own expense, with no incentive to
get rid of any that are infected but appear healthy. This cannot be allowed to
happen.

October 24th
Traffic Queuing Blues
We were off on holiday, driving in leisurely fashion through the shire counties of
middle England, that is if it is possible to drive anywhere in a leisurely fashion
these days. Even on the smallest by-roads, pulling in to let impatient drivers
pass gives you only a few seconds to view the countryside, before another vehicle
is so tight on your tail that you wonder if it carries a passenger going into labour
or having a heart attack. We managed, nevertheless, to take three whole days
to reach the Norfolk coast, and went on to spend a week exploring what is
probably the most famous area of farmland in English agricultural history, the
home county of Turnip Townsend and Coke of Holkham.
Jenny and I must have wandered haphazardly on holiday in recent years
through every county of the UK, but Norfolk has always eluded us. So we were
determined this time to complete the set and were not disappointed, although
439

2007
finding B&Bs was far from easy. Aside from visiting the obvious tourist spots,
like the Norfolk Broads, Norwich Keep and Cathedral, the prehistoric flint mines
of Grime’s Graves in Thetford Forest, and Sandringham, I was most anxious to
see the Holkham Hall estate of Thomas Coke. We visited Holkham twice, once
in the pouring rain, driving through the farmland, still laid out and farmed very
much as in Coke’s day in the late 18th century, and again walking in the park
where the ‘Shearings’, the forerunner of today’s agricultural shows took place.
Unfortunately the farm museum was closed for the season, where I had been
hoping to find out more about Coke the man, to flesh out the iconic image I
have of him as the leading livestock breeder of his day. He inherited Holkham
Hall in 1776, at the age of 22, and farmed the 40,000 acre estate until his death
in 1842. He married twice, the second time to someone 50 years his junior,
and had nine children. He was also Member of Parliament for Norfolk for 53
years. Apparently he was offered a peerage seven times by six different Prime
Ministers, by Whigs as a reward and by Tories as a bribe, but preferred to
be known as plain Mr Coke. Now there is an example for farming leaders to
emulate today. He did eventually accept an Earldom from Queen Victoria,
becoming the 1st Earl of Leicester when he was 83, so that the sons of his
second marriage might inherit his title. He must have been some character and
a return one-day to visit that farm museum is definitely on the cards.
We came home via the peak district and Manchester, to spend two days
with our daughter, Mel, and her family. En route, we came upon one of the
worst traffic jams I have ever experienced. On an A-road somewhere between
Chesterfield and Stockport we crawled along for what seemed hours in a 15 mile
queue of cars and lorries moving at about two car lengths a minute. How much
CO2 that was throwing into the atmosphere I can’t imagine, but I am told it is
a fairly normal occurrence. If DEFRA think drinking UHT milk is the answer
to global warming, they should try driving along that particular stretch of road.
We arrived back to the dreadful news that Jake Jackson, a close friend of
our son Jim, had died in a tragic accident while on holiday in the Shetlands.
Jake once described himself to me as an oak timber-framer, but that nowhere
near does justice to the insight and skill with which he designed and created
the most beautiful oak buildings, using the tools and techniques of carpenters
from long ago. I remember him winning first prize for his timber frame exhibit
at the Southwest Forest Woodfair at Roadford in 2004 using oak that Jim had
sawn from our woodland. He leaves evidence of his craftsmanship in places
as far apart as Southern England, Wales and Scotland, in buildings as diverse
as at Windsor Castle or a thatcher’s barn, in a new house, stable, studio, or
garage. Jake was only 39, but the three hundred year-old oak with which he
440

Oct 31st

Massive Cull Won’t Happen

worked should still be there 500 hundred years from now, a mere featherweight
in carbon footprint. At least the knowledge and expertise he acquired in that
short time has been passed on to the friends who worked with him, and who
will continue to construct timber frame buildings in the time honoured fashion.

October 31st
Massive Cull Won’t Happen
The winter is upon us and I am not referring to the season - just the wretched
law that makes us put our clocks back. Does anyone really want daylight to fade
an hour earlier from the end of October? As a lad, I was told it had something
to do with allowing farmers extra light in the early hours to prepare their horses
for the day’s work growing food for wartime Britain. Horses are long gone and
modern tractors generate enough light to illuminate a small village, so who
benefits from GMT? Let’s have BST all year round and call it British Time.
Meanwhile after a miserable summer, the exceptional autumn carries on
regardless of the clock. Everywhere we travelled on our recent holiday, the
autumn seedbeds looked superb, with an even growth of new corn in the arable
fields, and no evidence of waterlog damage to the soils from the wet summer. We
also saw set-aside being sprayed, presumably to bring it back into cultivation.
It would never surprise me if arable farmers, in their enthusiasm following the
massive hike in corn prices this year, don’t suffer a downturn in their fortunes
next harvest. A little ‘up-horn down-corn’ would be very welcome for the rest
of us.
Back on the farm, we have at last got the remaining lambs away to slaughter. They should have gone two months ago, but due to the chaos of foot-andmouth and blue tongue regulations, they have been stuck here until well past
their prime. We are the lucky ones. Being organic, the price/kilo we get should
remain unchanged, unlike the disastrous level to which other lamb prices have
dropped in recent weeks. And I am told there are thousands of lambs, both
organic and ordinary, waiting to be sold. Does anyone at DEFRA properly understand that you cannot take two months supply of a livestock commodity out
of the supply chain without causing havoc. The feeble regrets from government
ministers will do nothing to keep sheep farmers solvent.
Fortunately we have had no fat bullocks due for sale and, with the settled
weather, all the cattle should be happy outdoors until nearer Christmas. That
is especially true of the autumn calvers, which are producing calves on a regular
basis at the moment. Newly born calves do far better outside in the fresh air
441

2007
- cold nights don’t seem to worry them, provided they have somewhere dry to
lie.
Off the farm, TB in cattle and the possibility of a badger cull are back in the
farming headlines, thanks to a carefully delayed recommendation by Sir David
King, the government’s chief scientific adviser. He correctly, in the opinion of
many farmers, disputes the conclusion of the recent Bourne Report that any cull
will merely exacerbate the problem, since Professor Bourne was only looking at
one form of culling – cage trapping. However, King, in proposing a cull, goes
on to agree with Bourne that, for this to be effective, it needs to be over a very
wide area, a minimum of 100 sq kilometres at least, but fails to consider any
evidence to show that a different form of culling could succeed in much smaller
areas, involving the deaths of far fewer badgers, and only in the diseased setts.
Forget a massive cull – it is simply never going to happen. For a start,
many land owners and farmers, let alone the general public, will never tolerate
it. Where are the natural barriers, which are necessary for it to succeed in
Devon and Cornwall – the M5, the English and Bristol Channels? Attempting
to slaughter 80% of the badgers in such a huge area is a preposterous idea. I
am inclined to believe that Sir David King intended to stir up controversy by
suggesting it, knowing that the adverse public reaction would allow government
to stall for the remainder of this parliament.
The sooner we start doing what we did successfully 40 years ago, and should
have been doing for the past 20 years, the sooner we shall beat this heartbreaking and costly disease. Farms where TB keeps recurring and where cattle
are not being introduced from other herds, should be licensed to take out the
badgers, using carbon monoxide gas under veterinary supervision, and kept free
of badgers until the herd goes clear. That is what farmers and vets have been
advocating for years, it will eventually happen, and the public will tolerate it.
Waiting any longer is about as stupid as the unnecessary fiddling with our clocks
twice a year.

No Going Back for Wildlife
It is impossible to turn the clock back and, in my opinion, it is a complete waste
of time trying. I am not referring to British Summer Time, but to the efforts
of the various wildlife charities, which seem to have this fixation with harking
back to a countryside that existed over fifty years ago.
It is an attitude to wildlife conservation that, as a keen young naturalist, I
never came across when I was a teenager. Certainly, in those days, there were
442

Nov 7th

No Going Back for Wildlife

forward looking ornithologists like Peter Scott, whom I was lucky enough to
meet once at an illustrated talk on wildfowling, a year or so before he founded
the Severn Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge. There was no suggestion then that we
should look back to the way the countryside was managed in the 19th century in
order to conserve the numbers of wild geese, in which he took such an interest.
These days, the emphasis seems to be on recreating farmland habitats to
raise the populations of plants and animals to what they were when farming
methods maintained these habitats naturally, even on occasion reintroducing
species that have become extinct. I am referring to the old ways of farming
that produced wild flower meadows filled with butterflies and sweet smelling hay
fields, culm grassland and coastal pastures for cirl buntings, corn fields where
weeds like poppies and cornflowers thrived however much they were discouraged.
Even the gentler pace at which we ploughed and sowed, made hay and harvested
encouraged wildlife in ways that modern machinery and a smaller workforce
cannot imitate. We can reproduce these artificially at a cost, but even with the
most imaginative marketing, never at a profit.
I raise the subject now, because it is a year since a new quango, Natural
England, was set up to bring together the three government bodies that were
involved in managing the countryside. I was somewhat critical at the time,
suggesting that it was just another example of ministerial pack shuffling to make
it appear that the government was doing something new and positive. I believe
I may have been a little hasty in coming to that view. Natural England is now
responsible for the various schemes that reward us for farming in a particular
way that benefits landscapes and farmland wildlife. We are participating in two
of them – Countryside Stewardship and the Organic Entry Level Scheme.
Apart from a new address for dealing with the inevitable form filling, little
else seems to have changed. There have been no alterations to the conditions of
the schemes and, thankfully, we have the same field adviser. But, unless I am
much mistaken, there is one aspect of the new set up which gives me hope for
the future. Although we are still funded through the Rural Payments Agency,
we are no longer under the direct jurisdiction of DEFRA. It may be only one
step away from the shadow of that much-maligned ministry, but at least it is
a step in the right direction. Our ten-year Stewardship Scheme has only three
years left to run. While many of the elements we agreed to comply with have
made little visible impact on the biodiversity of the farm, the proper laying-in
and fencing of our miles of hedgerows will be there to benefit both our cattle
and sheep management and the wildlife for many years to come. The long-term
advantages of going organic have yet to be experienced, but at least by the end
443

2007
of that five-year scheme, if it proves unprofitable, we can revert to mainstream
production overnight.
However what has changed in the last twelve months and what may have
a dramatic effect on the uptake in the future of these various environmental
schemes, and there are about eleven of them, is the price of wheat. The incentive
in all these schemes is calculated on the profit forgone, if any, in the management
of our farms in some restrictive way. And the crop around which the value of
all our farm production, and therefore average profitability, has traditionally
revolved is wheat. And what has happened to the price of wheat since most of
these environmental schemes were set up? Three or four years ago it was about
£70 a ton. Last year at this time it was up to nearly £100, and this year it has
reached the unexpectedly high price of £170 a ton. That could make life very
difficult for Natural England, but on past form, it is certainly a better bet than
DEFRA.

CAP Is Just Not Common
Like it or loathe it, we are part of the EU. It so happens I like it, or more
accurately, I prefer it to any alternative form of cooperation with our European
neighbours. When Ted Heath got us into the EU all those years ago, ostensibly
by throwing UK agriculture to the wolves, I, like many other farmers, felt that
the Common Agricultural Policy protected us to some extent from a return to
the depression years of the thirties. I still believe that had we not joined Europe
when we did, the politicians of all parties would have happily allowed cheap
European surpluses to flood our markets, in the same way that the USA and
Commonwealth countries laid waste to British agriculture between the wars.
However, with the days of food surpluses behind us, the CAP seems to have
stopped acting to ensure that farmers across Europe are not unfairly discriminated against in their access to the market. That is surely what a sensible EU
agricultural policy should aim to do if it is to guarantee sufficient food for its
citizens at prices they can afford and grown in the areas most suitable for its
production.
Unfortunately, Brussels bureaucrats, while continuing to produce endless
lists of regulations on how we must manage our farms, are now allowing exemptions to any member state applying for them. For example, as Anthony Gibson
recently pointed out, countries competing with us in the production of suckler
beef, where direct subsidies are supposed to have been phased out, have come up
with schemes quite contrary to this principle - and with a blessing from Brussels.

CAP Is Just Not Common

The French are planning to reintroduce suckler cow headage-payments and the
Irish are bringing in suckled calf ‘welfare’ payments for just looking after calves
in the normal way. Is there any chance that we might persuade our government
along similar lines? Not on your life. In fact in our case it works in quite the
opposite direction. Our government seems quite oblivious to the effect that the
gold-plating of EU regulations has on our ability to compete.
Nowhere is this more obvious than the way animal health has been dealt with
in the last few years. When bovine TB gets out of control, the compensation
rates for all animals compulsorily slaughtered under the Notifiable Diseases
Act are substantially reduced. When a second outbreak of FMD in five years
occurs, due entirely to a lack of government action on the recommendations of
the Dr Anderson ‘Lessons Learned Inquiry’ following the first outbreak (which
incidentally was apparently due to a Ministry vet failing to close down a licencebreaking swill processing farm), what does the government do? It does not set
up a proper Committee of Inquiry, which it should have done in the first place,
but sets up a second Dr Anderson ‘Lessons Learned Inquiry’, which will get
us nowhere except to ensure that no one is held liable, thus making a case for
compensation very difficult to prove.
The government goes even further. To help pay for its own incompetence,
it is intending to impose a levy on livestock farmers towards the cost of dealing
with future disease outbreaks. The reaction in Brussels to that proposal is
less than helpful. The UK has been given a derogation allowing us to compost
waste meat, including kitchen waste which may contain joints of meat past their
sell by date, on farmland in the open air, something that is banned under EU
composting regulations. Robert Persey, a one-time pig farmer, whose business
was closed down by FMD five years ago, tells me that this almost unbelievably
risk-taking procedure is already taking place, purely as a cheap way of achieving
EU recycling targets and avoiding heavy fines.
And that’s not the end of the government’s penny-pinching attitude to animal health problems. In the last few days, proposals have been agreed for dealing with bluetongue, the latest devastating plague threatening livestock. The
European Commission is intending to adopt and finance a harmonised mass
vaccination programme for all susceptible animals in areas where the disease is
present, beginning early next year. Thank heavens for that, say all livestock
farmers. But wait – one member state has reservations about the proposals,
preferring some flexibility on how any mass vaccination is implemented. Yes,
you’ve guessed it – it is the UK. Presumably our government is considering how
to make our farmers pay for vaccination, while farmers in the rest of Europe
445

2007
are financed from Brussels. And now, to add to our troubles, the fates have hit
us with another outbreak of bird flu.

November 21st
Optimism on Meat Prices
We have had some of the best autumn weather I can remember. The brown
and russet leaf-colours of the oak woods that surround the farm are only now
beginning to fade as the leaves fall. Although we have had a few frosty mornings,
sharp for so early in November, and spells of intermittent rain now softening
the pastures, all the cattle are still out. We are feeding hay and silage scattered
from a trailer in our usual fashion, without any obvious damage to the land.
How long we can continue remains to be seen, but every day makes the winter
shorter, with the cattle looking contented and the younger calves even chasing
each other around as if spring was in the air.
The farm wildlife has also obviously enjoyed the spectacular autumn. There
is a small herd of about ten red deer that have been appearing out of the woods
every morning over the last two months, making a very pleasant sight as they
graze the neighbour’s fields across the valley, where I prefer to see them. We
have always had roe deer on the farm, but the presence of more than one or two
red deer is unusual. Doubtless, as the woodland cover declines, they will move
back towards Exmoor from where I assume they came, but I have no idea what
brings them here only in certain years.
Our resident barn owl is back in his winter quarters, the old stone barn
adjacent to our house where I believe he was hatched. He pays little heed to us
as he hunts round the edges of nearby fields in late afternoon, but will often hiss
a greeting when disturbed by our headlights as we return from a late night out.
If I’ve guessed the sexes correctly, I presume it is his mate that I sometimes
see in the buildings of my brother-in-law’s farm next door. Separate hunting
territory obviously gives a better chance of survival if the winter is a hard one.
Are there signs of a hard winter? The holly berries, sweetened by the recent
frosts, are certainly fast disappearing down the throats of a busy bunch of
blackbirds and thrushes much earlier than usual. And more strangely, our one
remaining colony of wild bees has been working frantically throughout October.
Jim, who has abandoned beekeeping in recent years, also made the surprise
discovery that two of his empty hives were suddenly alive with bees, but where
they originated is a mystery. Do they know something we don’t, or is this
normal behaviour in an unusual autumn.

Anomolies of Organic Regulations

After the atrocious summer, and all the other troubles that have beset farming this year, I should actually welcome some really cold weather, frozen pipes
and water-bowls aside. That may seem a strange wish, but provided it lasts for
only a few weeks, a good hard spell, something that has been lacking in recent
winters, would do us a lot of good. Leaving aside the reduction in pests and
diseases, including the bluetongue midge, which would result from a period of
continuous low temperatures, the possibility of an upsurge in demand for red
meat by a shivering nation would be a real bonus for a beleaguered livestock
industry.
However, being realistic, with the shortest day only a month away, the coming weather will probably revert to normal - wet and mucky until the beginning
of March. That doesn’t stop me being optimistic that all meat prices will rise
substantially over the next six months. I am not pinning my hopes on the recently launched NFU campaign to highlight the plight of beef and sheep farmers.
That may well prepare people to expect higher prices in the shops, just as the
campaign to raise milk prices gained public sympathy. With the huge increase
in feed prices in recent months, I believe livestock farmers are more likely to
reduce dependence on bought in feed to stay in business, and production will
be cut to match. World meat supplies are not assured, and the big retailers
know it.
We have done enough talking about how badly off we are. The coming
months may well see fewer animals reared, to which the trade will have to
respond with realistic contracts to guarantee supplies, as it did with the realisation that milk production was in sharp decline. Let’s hope I’m right before
too many beef and sheep farmers pack it in altogether. The number of farmers
remaining in business is more important just now, than the amount of beef and
lamb we produce.

November 28th
Anomolies of Organic Regulations
I recently came across the very curious assertion that ‘Organic farming’s role in
alleviating poverty cannot be overstated’. It was in the winter edition of ‘Living
Earth’, the magazine of the Soil Association. The phrase was used in an article
on what the Soil Association should do about airfreight. The words might just
have made sense if they had been referring to farmers like us trying to make a
living producing beef and lamb in the UK over the last few years. But in the
context of transporting fruit and veg from third world countries, where farming
is very largely organic anyway, alleviating poverty might conceivably be better
447

2007
served by intensifying farming, the better to feed themselves and with a surplus
to sell on the world market. Facing famine, does it matter if food is organic or
not?
I don’t wish to knock the Soil Association - as a member and licensee, it
is in a sense, our organisation. But I am worried about the implication that
only organic food should be air freighted and then only if it delivers genuine
benefits to farmers in developing countries. The Soil Association says it will
be doing all it can to encourage these farmers to build organic markets that do
not depend on air freight. What do the poorer non-organic farmers in Africa
and Asia have to say about that when uttered by people living in a society
that thinks nothing of flying for a short winter holiday to the Mediterranean
to soak up some sun, or a long weekend in North America to join the family
for thanksgiving? While we continue flying around the world just for the hell
of it, I don’t believe we have the right to preach to people about how they
must observe our regulations on transporting fresh food. Modern transport
and its effect on the environment is a worldwide problem and is not something
about which a national organisation, however well meaning, should be making
regulations. Let’s stick to the regulations that we are obliged to observe to
prove we are farming organically and there are plenty enough of them.
Nearer home, I confess that, for myself, after a rather sceptical first two
years, I am now getting more interested in looking for changes in the health
and wellbeing of the livestock and the soil on the farm. There have been two
health problems in the cattle during this time. The first was due to the sudden
absence of mineral supplements for all the cattle, which showed up as a serious
selenium deficiency in the first crop of calves, and for which we have since had a
derogation allowing us to return to feeding extra minerals to balance a shortage
in our soil. Perhaps farming organically will eventually correct this imbalance.
The other problem occurred this summer, when about forty store cattle
started showing symptoms typical of lungworm. Before going organic, we should
have immediately treated them all with a suitable drench, but under organic
rules, Jim was obliged to take faeces samples for our vet to send away to check
for the presence of husk larvae. Which did not, in fact, show up. Time went
by and the cattle went on coughing, the vet offering to write a submission for
the Soil Association to allow Jim to treat them. Eventually, since none of the
bullocks seemed to be actually on its last legs, they were left to recover in
their own time. Perhaps organic cattle are tougher than non-organic cattle.
Whether it was lungworm, or a touch of contagious pneumonia we shall never
know. Would it have been better to treat them all at the outset, thus avoiding
what must have resulted in some lung damage?
448

Dilemma Over Our Old Cows

As for the soil, Jim has applied lime to about forty acres of permanent
pasture, something we have not done for many years, using instead a lime-based
artificial nitrogen fertiliser. Half has been ploughed up and put into a cereal
rotation, the very expensive organic triticale seed coming from Herefordshire.
I believe, due to a shortage this autumn, some organic cereal seed has had to
be imported – seed miles! I am looking forward to seeing the effect the lime
has on the clover content of the remaining grass ground next summer. I am left
with two questions - how does organic triticale seed differ from non-organic and
what is the actual difference between nitrogen produced by clover and nitrogen
applied in a slow acting lime-based fertiliser?

December 5th
Dilemma Over Our Old Cows
Back in March, we had a downer cow. She had probably been roughly treated
by our bull and was quite unable to get to her feet. She remained like that for
the best part of three weeks until the day of our TB herd test. The sight of the
vet advancing on her with tuberculin syringes at the ready had her standing
up instantly, the memory of his original precautionary injections obviously still
fresh in her mind. She appeared to have a badly torn ligament in her hip, which
gave her little control over one back leg, making it difficult for her to get up or
walk properly. The vet reckoned she was in no pain and we put her out in a
nearby paddock to recover.
I wrote about it at the time and as the summer wore on, we had some
enquires about her progress. Although she regained condition and learned to
get around fairly well, the damage to her hip seemed permanent. It looked as
if, come the autumn, the kindest option open to us would be to have her put
down on the farm. She might have been worth something as a barrener, but
there was no way we were prepared to let her travel in a cattle truck. That was
until a couple of months ago, when it became apparent that the bull, for all
his roughness, had succeeded in getting her in calf. Whether she would calve
successfully and be able to stand up afterwards was a risk we were prepared to
take, although we had some misgivings.
Last Friday, she started calving, two weeks early and back feet first. Assuming the calf was probably dead, we got her in and, using traction, Jim delivered
a small inanimate heifer calf, which with a bit of help, started breathing. By
nightfall, the cow had cleansed, was on her feet and the calf was suckling. Today
the calf is skipping around the pen as if having a mother with only three good
legs is quite normal. Life on the farm does occasionally astonish me.
449

2007
Having one extra cow and calf is undoubtedly a bonus, but we are faced with
the possibility that by this time next year, we shall have had to get rid of fifteen
of our older and more dependable cows. Farmers are being urged by DEFRA
to submit animals born before August 1996 to be slaughtered under the terms
of Older Cattle Disposable Scheme, the final BSE compensation scheme which
finishes on 31 Dec 2008. After this date, any remaining older cattle will not
be eligible for compensation, amounting to about £200 for this final year, and
these may have to be slaughtered and incinerated at the owner’s expense.
I can quite understand that DEFRA is keen to bring to an end its responsibility for removing all cattle over a certain age from entering the food chain. This
was introduced ten years ago as a precautionary measure against the spread of
BSE. There are now only a finite number of animals left alive that might have
had access to contaminated feed. Unfortunately most of them are in suckler
herds, where little if any contaminated feed was used, and where the compensation for being unable to sell them as good manufacturing beef has been derisory.
It seems that once more, for the greater good, suckler herd owners have drawn
the short straw.
We are left with a dilemma. I cannot, at present, find out how much we
may be charged for disposing of our old sucklers, cows that are quite capable of
rearing another three or four calves, if Jim does decide to withhold them from
the scheme. I know he is willing to forgo the £200 compensation and have them
eventually slaughtered humanely on farm, but we cannot afford to end up with
a whacking great bill for something that has been DEFRA’s responsibility for
the past ten years. If these cows do have to go in the next twelve months, we
should already be ensuring they do not get back in calf, otherwise we may be
left with very young calves next autumn with no mothers to suckle them. We
also have the problem of finding replacements for fifteen organic cows, which
do not come cheap. Surely it would be sensible to allow these animals to live
out their lives and eventually be treated as on-farm cow casualties. DEFRA
would save paying compensation and the cows would avoid that unnecessary
final journey to an abattoir.

Multiples Correctly Penalised

December 12th
Multiples Correctly Penalised
Christmas time is with us once again – carol singing, pantomimes and the
occasional fairy tale. And this year, farmers seem to have got a fairy story
of their own. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT), playing the part of the fairy
godmother on this occasion, has discovered that, once upon a time five years
ago, the big bad ogres, the major supermarkets, plotted together to make the
poor old British public pay over the odds for its daily pinta. Now farmers have
always suspected that supermarkets did a bit of casual colluding from time to
time, not in their offices obviously, but probably on the golf course or in the bar
at a business conference. Not, I hasten to add, to make the shopper pay more,
but in order to ensure the supplier did not get paid too much.
The companies involved, each having been fined several million pounds,
are now crying foul, pointing out that they haven’t made a penny out of the
increased prices and were only trying to support dairy farmers, at the behest
of politicians, including the then prime minister, Tony Blair who once famously
remarked that supermarkets had farmers in an armlock. They paid all the
extra cash over to the dairy processors, who should have passed it on. The
dairy companies implicated in the illegal shenanigans have also been fined, but
point out that they were only involved for the good of their milk producers,
some of whom did benefit from a rise in their milk prices at the time.
Here is where the story takes an unexpected twist. The OFT, in its press
release, says that it has taken into account information provided by the parties
involved, which demonstrated the pressures they were under to support dairy
farmers. For that reason, it appears to be willing to treat the law-breaking
companies very leniently, at least those that are prepared to make a clean breast
of things, by substantially reducing their already innocuous fines - £116m spread
over the likes of Asda, Sainsbury’s, Safeway, etc, which will hardly make a dent
in their vast profit margins. The OFT seems to be acting like a fairy godmother
to the big bad ogres in the fairy tale, instead of using the opportunity to impress
on the shopping public that even the big multinationals cannot play about with
food prices as the whim takes them.
What has been farmer reaction to all this? The NFU said it found it very
difficult to comment on the precise OFT announcement, whatever that means,
but leading farmers are quoted as suggesting that the supermarkets have been
wrongly fined for price fixing, when all they were doing was endeavouring to
pay dairy farmers more for their milk.
I simply cannot swallow that. The price of fresh milk in the supermarkets
451

2007
over recent years has been exorbitant – approaching three times the price the
farmer has been receiving. I know things have improved now that the retailers
have at last realised their supply is not guaranteed. It is also true that the
farm gate price depends on much more than the price of a pinta. But surely
fresh milk is the most bog standard item of all the products that are sold in
supermarkets. It is offered in all of them in virtually identical containers, in
identical sizes, at identical prices and in large quantities in a relatively small
shelf space. So far as the supermarkets are concerned, selling fresh milk is a
doddle. Shoppers just grab their usual container as they pass, without looking
at the price. If the price went up, I doubt they would notice and they certainly
would not change their preferred supermarket over it.
So why on earth did the big retailers bother to break the law and put their
reputations, their most valuable asset, at risk? They could have raised the price
independently and taken the credit for it. Or better still, paid their suppliers
out of their own pockets, without a noticeable tremble in their balance sheets.
I am afraid the truth is that these retailers think they are just too big for
the OFT to handle. The story is by no means over. Tesco and Morrisons are
still contesting the OFT’s findings. Only Waitrose and M&S come out of the
investigations smelling of roses and deserve full credit for that. But, at the end
of the day, it will be the OFT’s reputation that is on the line.

Lottery Over Farm Diseases
A year that will be chiefly remembered for the outbreak of one notifiable disease
after another is at last drawing to a close and no livestock farmer will mourn it’s
passing. That is hardly surprising when you consider the number of times we
have held our breath, with the ministry vets investigating the latest case of bird
flu, foot-and-mouth or bluetongue, to see whether it was our turn to have our
farms or markets closed down while an outbreak was dealt with. And although
we were lucky here in the southwest to escape any actual disease, the damage
to our businesses through movement restrictions and lost exports caused by the
Pirbright foot-and-mouth disaster, has run into millions.
Meanwhile, our region continues to suffer the ever-increasing burden of
bovine TB. What a dismal picture of life on the farm during the last twelve
months to welcome in the twelve days of Christmas, but I make no apologies. I
think, or rather I hope that on the animal disease front all is about to change
for the better. It cannot get much worse.
452

Dec 19th

Lottery Over Farm Diseases

For a start, it is obvious from DEFRA minister Jeff Rooker’s performance
at the recent cross-party Environment and Rural Affairs committee that the
government has thrown in the towel when it comes to dealing with animal
diseases. The Treasury is apparently not prepared to chuck any more money at
the shambles that DEFRA has created. I am not pointing a finger at the staff
at the Animal Health Department, who must be as disheartened as the farmers
they are trying to assist. The real fault lies with the various Animal Health
ministers who have been in charge of the department during the last ten years.
And to some extent with opposition spokesmen who have failed, with one or two
honourable exceptions, to alert the public to the horrendous and unnecessary
waste of taxpayers money that this political incompetence has produced.
There has also been a huge increase in the cost to livestock farmers, due
partly to a significant reduction in the compensation for the compulsory slaughter of animals caught up in an outbreak, but due mainly to the ministry’s blank
refusal to accept any financial responsibility for the blundering mistakes it has
committed in causing and attempting to control most of the recent outbreaks
of notifiable diseases.
A bizarre but typical example has just surfaced from the Parliamentary
and Health Service Ombudsman’s investigation into DEFRA’s ban on pigswill
processing, following the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak. The ban was brought
in at two weeks notice with little consultation and no compensation payable.
DEFRA has now been found guilty of misadministration, but the Ombudsman
has recommended that despite the findings, no compensation be paid to the
hundreds of farmers who lost their livelihoods as a result. What sort of justice
is that?
So why am I optimistic that things may be about to get better? Jeff Rooker
has just launched a consultation on sharing responsibility and cost on animal
health and welfare, with farmers helping to shoulder the considerable financial
burden imposed on taxpayers as a result of disease outbreaks. What he thinks
we have been doing all these years I have no idea, but he is also adamant that
we should have more involvement in the decision making process, with more
say in how disease is controlled and outbreaks are managed.
The consultation document, which at a first glance appears as full of ministry
gobbledegook as DEFRA’s longwinded communications usually are, runs to 60
pages with 40 questions to be answered by farmers. How many farmers will have
the time or inclination to respond properly is debatable, but perhaps that is the
intention. What is clear is that the government intends to tax livestock farmers
£120million over the next three years. If our only involvement in decisionmaking is in how the tax is levied, and silly suggestions like a levy on cereal
453

2007
growers selling grain for feed rather indicate that, the consultation is just a
farce. But if a tax really does include proper representation, then my hope
is that our representative bodies get stuck in and make something worthwhile
come out of it. If I am only dreaming, it is certainly not of a white Christmas.

We Need Farming R&D
I have to confess to being a chocoholic, especially at Christmas time. Naturally
the first shop we visited in the new Princesshay development during our Christmas shopping trip to Exeter was Hotel Chocolat. The display was sensational,
with prices to match. We were lucky that the lengthy queues at the checkouts
gave us ample excuse to escape with our credit cards intact. However, I was
immensely heartened at the sight of so many people happily forking out at least
double what I normally pay for chocolates.
I know it was Christmas, but even so, it is cheering to think that the British
public will hardly bat an eye as basic necessities double in price in the years
ahead. With bread at £2 a small loaf, milk at £1 a litre and rump steak at £20
a kilo farming will really stand on its own feet, without single farm payments
and all the needless bureaucracy. But leaving aside the doubtful assumption
that the world’s population will continue to increase at its present rate, the
climate changes we are already experiencing will make it nearly impossible to
produce enough food unless we get our act together quickly.
If my memory serves me correctly, when I first arrived in Devon looking for
a farm, Princesshay was just one of a number of cleared bombsites being used as
car parks. I have no idea what Exeter looked like before the war, and I imagine
it has changed out of all recognition since then. Over the years I have watched
it being first rebuilt and then developed and expanded to become what I see as
my home city. Now, suddenly, a large shopping precinct that was, I thought,
the pride and joy of a city rising from the ashes, is considered past it, pulled
down and rebuilt presumably at vast expense. I hope it proves worthwhile, but
I reckon the money could have been better spent.
When the original Princesshay was being planned, rural Devon was at the
455

2008
beginning of huge changes in how we farmed. It is hard to believe that at the
time most of the cows were still being milked by hand, hay balers and combineharvesters were just appearing, chainsaws and mechanical hedge trimmers were
unknown. And that was just the hard-graft side of farming. The real advances
in agriculture were taking place in our universities and colleges. Artificial insemination in cattle was in its infancy, new crop varieties, fertilizers, sprays and
veterinary medicines were appearing, and a great deal of investigation was going
into the functioning of crops and livestock. Our research and development was
second to none in the world.
There are those who believe that intensification in farming went too far too
fast, but at the time we were given the job of doubling food production without
allowing food prices to rise. And we succeeded handsomely with little thanks
from the nation - just the oft repeated jibes about featherbedding. However it
was, without question, the scientific research of those days that made it possible.
Agriculture once again faces a challenge, this time of global proportions.
Food production is at the forefront in the battle against climate change, with
agricultural emissions apparently causing twenty per cent of the problem. At
present the only remedy demanded of us is yet more regulation in the way we
farm. We seem to be ignoring the fact that most of the elements that cause this
pollution are actually the building blocks of farming. Recycling, rather than
restricting these emissions is surely the solution, and for that we urgently need
scientific research.
Farming leaders have been saying for years that our research facilities are
woefully inadequate, but the plea seems to be falling on deaf ears. Devon is
the largest farming county, but we have recently closed Seal Hayne, one of the
finest agricultural colleges in the country. Exeter University’s agricultural department, for which many of us have provided farm statistics over the years, has
now gone. Bicton College seems to be offering more courses on environmental
management than food production. IGER, the research facility at North Wyke,
doing vital work on agricultural emissions, is apparently starved of funds. If
Exeter can afford to build a state of the art new shopping centre, surely Devon
can do better in providing farmers with the research needed to save the planet.

Taking Care on Poultry

January 9th
Taking Care on Poultry
I see that two very popular television chefs, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and
Jamie Oliver, are attempting to change the nations attitude to welfare standards
in poultry production in a series of programmes on Channel 4 this week. I shall
be watching with great interest. Not that I am much of a fan of either chef
- they put me off attempting to have anything to do with what goes on in a
kitchen, beyond peeling the potatoes or helping with the washing up, and they
do it quicker than any of the horde of expert cooks that crowd the airwaves.
I am not a chicken farmer, but I am very concerned when I read the advance
blurb quoting Jamie Oliver saying that if changes are not made, there may not
be a British poultry industry in 20 years time. I have no doubt that the phrase
immediately conjures up the words “calf crates and sow tethers” in the minds of
every livestock farmer in the country. These were systems of animal husbandry
that needed to be outlawed, but not unilaterally, under public pressure in this
country alone, when our trading relations with the rest of Europe force us to
allow all foodstuffs to cross national borders freely.
Our dynamic duo need to be careful that this does not turn into a campaign
for new legal standards in Britain that merely export the bulk of our poultry
industry to wherever in the world it can legally be produced at a fraction of
the cost. But I doubt that is exactly what Jamie Oliver meant. At present the
big retailers may feel they have a moral obligation to stock high welfare poultry
products, but they certainly understand that the highly competitive nature of
their business compels them to have cheap chicken on their shelves if that’s
what the public wants.
I confess to having difficulty with this idea that free-range poultry, so beloved
of the welfare lobby, are necessarily living a carefree life. Free-range units are
springing up on farms all around us. The birds do appear to have plenty of
green grass to scratch around on, but they still look pretty thick on the ground
to me. All very well in summer time, but what about a really rough spell of
winter weather? The chicken houses in which they feed and shelter at night look
hardly large enough to accommodate them for days on end if we are snowed
in for a couple of weeks. Global warming certainly does not rule that out –
in fact extremes of weather may become the norm. There is also the very real
possibility that sporadic outbreaks of avian flu may force poultry to be housed
on a number of occasions every year. I know that under organic regulations, the
smaller number of birds kept in each unit does allow for this, but the price at £10
or more for an oven-ready chicken may be too much for the average shopper. Nor
457

2008
am I too enthusiastic about the RSPCA’s Freedom Food designation, where,
unless I am mistaken, the five freedoms are only a declared aspiration, with
only two guaranteed by the contract. The so-called five freedoms are surely the
aspiration of every farmer who keeps livestock.
There is also the problem of predators and the panic chicken experience when
attacked. Shooting and fencing can control foxes, but round here the biggest
threat comes from ravens, which can dispatch fully-grown hens with ease, even
carrying them off alive if disturbed. Ravens are a protected species and, in
theory, have to be tolerated. Like any form of wildlife enjoying that status in a
farm situation with free meals constantly available, they are rapidly increasing
in number. The only free-range chicken that I have seen that appeared to be
living in their natural habitat, was on a farm where they roamed in willow
coppice grown on a rotational basis for fuel production. Planting trees may
be another solution and I know of one poultry farm where this is being done
very successfully, but the system does preclude the idea of moving the birds
regularly to fresh ground. At the end of the day, if I were unfortunate enough
to be a chicken with the rain sheeting down as I write, I would settle for a good
old-fashioned deep litter house, provided space was not at a premium.

January 16th
Exhaust Used as a Fertiliser
I thoroughly enjoy a spot of agricultural crystal gazing, especially after reading
about some new technique or scientific development that might revolutionize
the way we farm. There have been plenty of these in recent years, some not
always welcomed by the general public, but most contributing to a feeling of
excitement about the future. One such came to my notice the other day in an
article about a bizarre method of increasing soil fertility.
Apparently during 2007, forty-five farmers in Canada, the USA and Australia have been diverting tractor exhaust gases back into the ground when
sowing cereals and oilseeds, using the air systems of their modern pneumatic
drills. Gary Lewis, an Alberta farmer and soil scientist, who pioneered this novel
procedure, claims that the CO2 in exhaust increases microorganism activity by
boosting the amount of carbon in the soil.
Increasing natural fertility in this way has apparently led to a saving of up
to half the fertilizer needed - one Manitoba 5000-acre grain producer slashing
his fertiliser bill by over £136,000 without reducing yields. The comment I
really liked was the afterthought by Mr Lewis that it also helped to reduce the
emissions of greenhouse gases. He reckons that 95% of a tractor’s exhaust is
458

Jan 16th

Exhaust Used as a Fertiliser

captured in this way and there is a huge saving in the emissions that are avoided
by not producing or transporting fertilizer that is no longer used. He obviously
sees this as, first and foremost, an improved method of arable farming, and not
something designed to save the planet.
If these claims turn out to be accurate, the long-term implications are staggering. It may be that soils in Europe, having been farmed for centuries longer
than those of Australia and North America, are naturally higher in carbon, so
that any benefit from injecting exhaust gases may be less dramatic. But it is
surely worth testing, or is the experimental work already taking place; after
all, thousands of acres of corn are sown annually with air seeders in the UK –
nowadays they are the standard equipment of larger arable farmers and agricultural contractors. In view of the escalating cost of fertiliser and the draconian
regulations hanging over us to prevent nitrogen leaking into our waterways, the
cost of adapting existing seed drills will be a minor consideration. Presumably
a licence fee is also involved since Mr Lewis’s Canadian company is bound to
have patented the process.
Coming nearer home now that we are organic, I wonder what this technique
would do to raise yields where no artificial fertiliser is applied at all. The
Soil Association can hardly object, considering how much fossil fuel is already
used in the extra cultivations necessary for rotational farming and organic weed
control. Daydreaming even further, I can visualise additions and modifications
to tractor exhaust systems that can be switched to inject waste gases into
the ground wherever fieldwork is being carried out – hay making, silaging,
ploughing, harvesting, and so on.
Now that there is an increasing likelihood that carbon accounting will be
added to the long list of business records all farmers are required to keep,
anything seen as automatically reducing our carbon footprint must be a bonus.
If carbon sequestration were to become a real income earner, which I suppose is
theoretically just possible, the web-based calculator for working out the balance
of greenhouse gases emitted by a farm set against the gases absorbed, which
the Country Land and Business Association has just launched, could end up
being used as an accounting tool for claiming grants from DEFRA’s ‘Climate
Change’ department, if such a thing exists.
Perhaps I am letting my imagination run away with me. It would be naive
to think that today’s farming can absorb more emissions than we produce, since
our worst pollutants, nitrous oxide and methane, are not exhaust gases. But
it is certainly something to aim at with whatever new technology arises in the
future. There will be new ways of producing food without using farmland (we
already have hydroponics and industrial heat exchange units) and, dare I say
459

2008
it, GM technology is as yet untapped in the UK. But the simple idea of using
tractor exhaust as a fertiliser – that really is a winner.

Bluetongue Threat Explained
Farmer meetings are often a pretty good waste of time, apart from the pleasure
of getting together with old friends for a chat about the state of the industry, the
diabolical weather or the latest lunacy to come out of DEFRA. But occasionally
there are meetings that turn out to have been really worth attending. I went
to such a one last week at the Exeter Livestock Centre, which was designed
to put farmers fully in the picture over industry plans to tackle Bluetongue,
the latest livestock plague to hit the UK. The meeting, which was organised
by the National Sheep Association and the Livestock Auctioneers Association,
had Robert Ankcorn, Veterinary Adviser to Intervet UK Ltd and Peter Morris,
chief executive of the NSA as the two speakers, and was chaired by Ben MesserBennetts, current chairman of the LAA.
Robert, after spending thirty years in large animal practice in Yorkshire,
opted for an easier life working as a consultant with Intervet, the pharmaceutical
company with which, as it happens, DEFRA has placed an order for bluetongue
vaccine. Robert was therefore the ideal person to explain in detail how the
disease affected sheep and cattle, and the vaccination programme required to
control it.
It seems that although bluetongue can be devastating for sheep farmers, with
severe symptoms requiring time-consuming nursing for animals that survive,
and significant levels of sterility in succeeding years, it is a disease that has to
be taken just as seriously by those of us who keep cattle. Cattle certainly appear
to be far less affected than sheep, with many showing no obvious symptoms, but
they do have a tendency to become less productive, and therefore uneconomic
and, what is worse, they act as the main reservoir of infection, keeping the
disease circulating.
Turning to vaccination, Robert was satisfied that Intervet would be able to
deliver the 22.5million doses during 2008 that will be needed to get a grip on
bluetongue if it flares up this spring, as it almost certainly will. The vaccine has
gone through the rigorous testing regime required of any vaccine to prove its efficacy, although over a two-year period instead of the usual five plus, which shows
what can be done when the devil drives. Sheep will need to be vaccinated once
every year, but will pass on three months immunity to their lambs, a blessing
for those of us who can finish lambs straight off the ewe. Cattle will require two
460

Jan 30th

Postal Ballot for President

doses a couple of months apart, but also every year. This is obviously a serious
drawback, since most vaccines we have used in the past give lifetime immunity.
It seems strange, since animals that have contracted bluetongue appear to be
immune thereafter, and is obviously something that needs remedying.
Peter Morris, who with the chairman, Ben Messer-Bennetts, has been very
involved in all the stakeholder discussions both with DEFRA and on the continent, then explained how a vaccination programme is likely to be implemented.
For a start, we are very lucky that bluetongue only reached the UK last September, with around sixty cases to date. While it is reported that there have been
30,000 cases in Northern Europe, the real figure is probably nearer ten times
that number. Once midge activity starts again in the spring, and I for one
have already seen the occasional active midge, the disease will almost certainly
spread rapidly westwards. This, perversely, will help the severe problems that
were experienced in the autumn with the livestock movement restrictions, which
the restriction and surveillance zones imposed on us. With the whole of the UK
in one zone we can, at least, get on with job of marketing animals in an orderly
manner.
How soon the vaccine will be available, and where it will be used initially
are questions still to be answered. Peter felt it only fair to start in the eastern
counties that were hardest hit last year, but there were suggestions from the floor
that it might be more sensible to vaccinate where bluetongue was not present
and work inwards. To get the disease under control, 80% of susceptible animals
will need to be vaccinated, and since in practice this will almost certainly be on
a voluntary basis, it will be up to us to make sure we succeed.

January 30th
Postal Ballot for President
What is it about reaching the grand old age of 100 years that grabs the imagination? In case you didn’t know, this is the centenary year of the National
Farmers Union. The latest edition of the NFU’s monthly journal is full of it.
The Annual Conference later in February is going to be smothered by it. I’ve
no doubt our farming monarch will be sending Her royal congratulations in due
course. There may even be a gong in it for someone in the birthday honours
list. It would be churlish of me, therefore, not to add my compliments, although
I am more often inclined to find fault with the NFU’s performance.
Not that I have any intention of ceasing to criticise where necessary. As
a member for well over 50 years, I am surely entitled to point up any failure
by the NFU to protect its weaker members. For all the plaudits that will be
461

2008
strewn around during the coming months, that is the one area that has always
bothered me most. As today’s President, Peter Kendall, rightly says, “farming
is made up of a myriad of small family businesses” which the NFU attempts
to bind together into a single powerful lobby. I see that as protection for the
individual farmer against political and commercial forces outside our industry.
No doubt it will be denied, but the NFU seems to see itself more as a trade
association, speaking and working for the industry as a whole, rather than a
union of farmers, as its name suggests.
At the risk of being viewed as a spectre at the feast, I had better elaborate
a little. I am sometimes asked why there was so much militancy against the
NFU in the 1960s and 70s. At the time, it was the sole body representing
farmers at the Price Review negotiations. The annual haggling usually ended
with NFU claiming a reasonable outcome in difficult circumstances. What our
leaders, well-heeled farmers with the time to take on the often-thankless task of
running the NFU, generally overlooked was the return on capital that the 1947
Act specifically included as a production cost. Fine if you had no borrowed
money, but with farms to rent after the war at a premium, many of us just
starting had overdrafts and mortgages to finance. I can well remember on one
occasion being told by an NFU office holder that I had no cause for complaint,
since I should never have started farming with a mortgage. Small wonder that
some of us attempted to form a breakaway organisation.
More recently, the NFU has been much too ready to accept that size matters
when it comes to the survival of the smaller family farm. It will be denied,
but NFU negotiations with government too often sacrifice the minority for the
greater good. One obvious case is the way suckler herd owners were treated
through the BSE crisis. The Over Thirty Month Scheme, which probably saved
the beef industry, was not the brainchild of Sir David Naish, as Peter Kendall
claims, but a proposal that originated in the Westcountry from John Hoskin,
the Dorset chairman. David Naish, unfortunately, was responsible for accepting
at a later date a weight limit on the value of animals going into the scheme,
no problem for the majority of farmers with dairy cattle, but something that
nearly bankrupted those of us with our much heavier suckler cows.
Why am I not directing these remarks directly to the NFU top brass at the
forthcoming Annual Meeting? I have been campaigning for years for the AGM,
a natural safety valve, to be easily accessible to the ordinary member. As a nondelegate, I recall being barred from attending by Henry Plumb, the resulting
bad publicity opening the meeting to all members in the years that followed.
This was countered by the timing of AGMs, always in London, being brought
forward to 9am, difficult and expensive to attend without an overnight stay.
462

Birds to Take Priority

I once spent an uncomfortable night dossing-down on the pavement outside
the London Hilton, to embarrass the NFU into reverting to a more reasonable
midday fixture. AGMs are now usually held in Birmingham, but not in this
centenary year. We are back to the London Hilton at the even earlier hour
of 8.45 am. and I shall not be there. Surely the time has come, to ensure
accountability, for presidents to be elected by a postal ballot of all members, as
is done in Scotland. That way might ensure that presidents retain for longer
their original crusading vigour.

February 6th
Birds to Take Priority
I frequently get the impression that the RSPB considers birds to be more important than people in the great scheme of things. Take the latest outburst from
that somewhat self-opinionated organisation. It is very worried that farmers are
not setting aside enough set-aside this year and that, as a consequence, farmland birds will suffer. It is therefore urging Natural England, the government’s
environmental advisory agency, to demand that DEFRA make it compulsory
for farmers to set aside five per cent of their arable land as a condition for
receiving the Single Farm Payment.
What cheek! The Single Farm Payment is not in the gift of DEFRA: it
derives from the EU, is calculated in euros, and is conditional on decisions made
in Brussels. Let the RSPB take its concern about bird numbers to that even
more self-opinionated body, the European Commission. After all, it was the
Commission that dreamed up the preposterous idea of set-aside in the first place.
It had nothing to do with birds or any other form of wildlife – it was intended to
reduce the cost of export subsidies used for dumping surplus European grain on
world markets. Introduced in 1992 under the MacSharry reforms, set-aside may
have had the desired effect but was anathema to many of us, producing areas of
knee-high weeds and rushes. Farmland should be for producing food, or in some
circumstances, fuel or thatch. If the land is not needed, it should be allowed
to revert to its natural condition – woodland or heath. Set-aside is neither one
thing nor the other - it has become an agricultural entity in its own right, with
a 40-page DEFRA book of regulations for managing it and costing taxpayers
approximately £150million a year to subsidise in the UK alone. That is until
2005, since when it has cost nothing, except to farmers in lost production.
It is true that set-aside did give farmland birds throughout Europe a welcome boost with an artificial habitat at a time when farming was becoming
increasingly intensive. But I fail to see why the RSPB thinks it reasonable for
463

2008
UK farmers to continue with set-aside at our own expense, with cereals in short
supply and the European Commission quite correctly winding down the scheme
as part of the CAP health check. We don’t farm for the sake of our health - we
farm to make a living. There is an expense in managing set-aside, but even if
there were not, the land itself generally has a rent, mortgage or other borrowing
to set against it. Are we expected to recoup this with a label on our produce
declaring it grown to RSPB set-aside standards and, if so, will shoppers in the
big cities have a clue what that means? They are far more likely to buy a
similar, but cheaper product from somewhere else in Europe, where set-aside is
not enforced.
I am worried that this is just the sort of suggestion that will appeal to the
DEFRA Secretary, Hilary Benn. He has so far shown very little understanding
of the agricultural industry, preferring to hide behind what he calls ‘public
opinion’ in making difficult decisions. Rather than upset what he must perceive
as a very strong lobbying force, Benn may well attempt to approach Brussels
for a derogation to allow the RSPB’s proposal to succeed. In recent years, the
RSPB has done much to encourage farmers to adjust modern food production
methods to allow as much wildlife to co-exist as possible. In many instances it
has enthused us to develop neglected areas of our farms into suitable habitat
for species under threat, and we have enjoyed doing it. It would be most
unfortunate if, by demanding that we now consign some of our better arable
land to this use, that goodwill were squandered.
In the light of the huge hike in the value of grain in the last twelve months,
which will almost certainly raise the price of our daily bread and Sunday roast,
it would be even more unfortunate if the public perception of the RSPB were
to change to one of an organisation actually obstructing farmers in their efforts
to keep food prices at an affordable level. It would be courting disaster if its
own members (of which I am one) began to wonder if the guiding principle of
the RSPB was that birds actually are more important than people.

History Repeats Itself
When I started farming here in 1951 there was a small orchard near the farmhouse. This, together with four small wet meadows and a steep arable field, in
all about 20 acres, was adjacent to a stone-and-slate threshing barn and roundhouse, on one side of an old Devon lane. The remaining 100 acres of the farm
were on the other side of the lane, with a couple of old cattle linhays situated
about 100yards uphill from the farmhouse.
464

Feb 13th

History Repeats Itself

One of the linhays had been converted a year before I came to a shippon
for eleven cows, but how the farm had been managed before that is not easy
to visualize. According to the old tithe map, the stone threshing barn and
roundhouse did not exist before 1840. Interestingly, there were at that time
three other small orchards, all conveniently near the farmhouse, so I conclude
that, with cider an important part of a farm worker’s wages, the farm had made
a living for more than just a single family. However the work force must have
declined over the years, since the landlord had obviously allowed the tenants to
let these three orchards die off and be grubbed up. The remaining orchard had
some nice dessert and cooking apples, but consisted mainly of cider varieties,
enough for me to make a 60-gallon barrel of some very rough cider the second
year I was here.
We milked cows in the shippon up the lane until the early 1960s, when we
converted the roundhouse to a milking parlour and built a covered cattle yard
and silage pit near the farmhouse. The size of our dairy herd began to increase
and the 20 acres to which it had easy access became very inconvenient divided
as it was into six little fields. The cows broke into the orchard occasionally and
barked some of the younger trees so badly they never recovered, and many of
the older trees needed replacing. Frankly, I had neither the enthusiasm nor the
money to do it, and instead, did what many farmers were doing at the time
– I got a bulldozer to rip out four of the hedgerows, and the apple trees with
them, making two decent sized fields. I was guilty of indulging in the act of
environmental vandalism that has hung like an albatross round the neck of the
agricultural industry ever since.
While we had the dairy cows, I never had any regrets. With a young family
growing up, we had to make a living. The cows were able to strip-graze or
paddock graze new leys without walking too far. But Jenny never really forgave
me - she was very fond of the orchard and tried to curb my bulldozing activities
where possible. However nothing in farming is forever. In the last few days,
Jim and Bev, my son and daughter-in-law, have planted a new orchard almost
exactly where that old orchard was. They have put in about thirty trees, old
English (and Devon) dessert and cooking apples plus a few cider, and a couple
of plums and a couple of cherries. And what names – Upton Pyne, Kirton
Fair, Killerton Sharp, Peasegood’s Nonsuch, Sops in Wine, American Mother,
Quarenden, Cornish Aromatic, to mention just a few.
In the coming months a new Devon hedgerow will be planted round the
orchard, replacing one that I pushed out years ago. And it is all thanks to our
Stewardship Scheme and the very able Natural England advisory officer who
oversees it. We are coming to the end of Stewardship and it has been well
465

2008
worthwhile. With farm incomes as poor as they have been in the last ten years,
this environmental work would never have been contemplated without financial
support. And it is work that should really be going on naturally on farms year
after year.
I am very worried that something that has turned out so well should now
be put in jeopardy. Why has DEFRA been allowed to get into such financial
straits that cuts of £12.5 million are predicted for Natural England, which
is responsible for farm environmental schemes? Our support payments from
Brussels are being reduced by our government through voluntary modulation
to fund these schemes. Is our money going to end up subsidising a dysfunctional
DEFRA and has the Prime Minister been sufficiently alerted to the black hole
into which it has descended? That is the question I would like to have asked
farming leaders had I been attending the NFU Annual Meeting next week.

February 20th
Get to Grips With Disease
I am not in the least surprised that bluetongue has now reached Devon. Not the
actual disease, so far as we know, but the ministry regulations that precede it as
it spreads westward. The day before the announcement was made by DEFRA
last week that we were in a surveillance zone, we were lucky enough to have
a batch of bullocks in lairage at Bodmin ready to be killed early the following
morning. I suspect it will be the last time this year that we shall avoid the
extra hassle of obtaining licences and spraying the inside of cattle lorries with
insecticide before moving animals off the farm.
It may also be the last time that our animals can travel to an abattoir without having to set off in the middle of the night. Apparently, organic cattle and
sheep have to be first in the queue in order to ensure there is no possibility of a
mix up with non-organic animals. In the event of an actual case of bluetongue
showing up in Devon, something that is very possible, we shall become a protection zone, which requires animals to be dealt with immediately on arrival at
an abattoir. For our cattle travelling to Bodmin, a 4am start will be an inconvenience, but for our lambs, which currently have to be taken to an abattoir in
South Wales for sale to Tesco, an all-night journey seems a little over the top.
Why do I suspect that bluetongue may already be in Devon? So far this
February there have been ten new isolated cases found on farms, all of them
as a result of premovement testing. It is assumed by DEFRA that they were
infected before the colder winter weather set in, the vector free period as it is
known. Some of them have only shown up as the boundaries of the surveillance
466

Feb 20th

Get to Grips With Disease

zone were gradually extended in our direction. I believe it was suggested that
the bull on a farm near Poole, which by failing a test last week pushed the
surveillance zone to the Cornish border, may have been infected in the autumn
by a stray midge blown across from France. Surely it really doesn’t matter
where the midge came from, it’s where it ended up that is important. The
fact remains that so far, in a three-week period, ten apparently healthy cattle
on widely separated farms across the south of England have been diagnosed as
carrying the live virus.
It follows, therefore, that DEFRA, knowing the total number of animals
that have been premovement tested in the last two months, should now be able
to extrapolate from the figures how many are likely to be carrying bluetongue
as isolated cases on farms all over the country. We may have been hoping that
the disease could be contained in the eastern counties until the midges were
active again, but the evidence seems all against that. A glance at the map of
the areas already under restriction makes it obvious that if we are to get to
grips with bluetongue this summer, the whole of England and Wales should
be premovement testing now as the only affordable way of finding out where
bluetongue is already established.
It follows that the cost should never have been borne by individual farmers,
but by the livestock industry as a whole. It is obviously one area where cost
sharing might one day be an option, but for now, after the shambles of disease
control last year, DEFRA owes it to us to pick up this expense for the two or
three months remaining while premovement testing is relevant. Perhaps I am
being unduly pessimistic, but I get the feeling that we are playing catch-up,
when we could be using what little time we have before new infection starts
taking place, to plan where the very inadequate supply of vaccine will do the
most good. Hilary Benn has announced that vaccine will be purchased directly
from DEFRA, so that some control should be possible in the early stages to
direct it to these areas. I can’t believe a free-for-all will serve anyone’s interests.
The next decision that DEFRA will then have to face is the question of
compulsory slaughter without compensation of what appear to be perfectly
healthy animals. Until sufficient vaccine is available to all farmers, it will be a
complete lottery which of us end up footing the bill for attempting to halt the
spread bluetongue this summer.

February 27th
Driven by Public Opinion
I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when I read, in Anthony Gibson’s column
last week, that the very first resolution ever passed at an NFU general meeting
called on the Government to do everything in its power to eradicate bovine TB.
Here we are 100 years later and what is the hottest topic in farming today –
the Government’s strategy for dealing with bovine TB.
You might assume nothing has happened in the intervening years, but that
is far from being the case. That original resolution was addressing a situation
where the national cattle herd was riddled with TB and thousands of people
were dying every year from drinking raw milk. By the 1970’s we had virtually
stamped out the disease both in humans, by pasteurising milk, and in cattle by
a rigorous programme of herd testing and the slaughter of any animal reacting
to the tuberculin skin test. However it proved impossible to eradicate TB in
some cattle herds without culling badgers, known to be the alternative host,
which was done successfully by gassing all the setts on that farm.
In 1973, something occurred that changed the picture entirely. A Badgers
Act was passed by parliament to protect the species from the vicious, so-called
sport, of badger baiting with dogs - a most laudable and long overdue piece
of legislation, but not intended to prevent the control and, if necessary, culling
of badgers if they were causing damage or harbouring disease. Now, 35 years
later, an upsurge of Badger Groups intent on preventing interference with the
species under any pretext, a succession of agriculture ministers afraid of their
own shadow on this issue, and a massive rise in the incidence of TB in cattle,
and we are back where we were 100 years ago.
I have written on this subject on numerous occasions and I have to confess
I am getting heartily sick of it. So, I should imagine, is everyone living here
in the Westcountry. But I make no apology for returning to it - our annual
TB test is due next week. We had our first and only breakdown three years
ago, and the thought of a repeat performance of the two-monthly testing regime
through that summer is a daunting one, especially now that compensation is
on a reduced scale, and makes no allowance for organic status. However, what
is infinitely worse is the fact that no decision has been taken in the intervening
years on how the government is going get to grips with the problem of infected
badgers.
If we should have a more serious breakdown this time and find ourselves
joining the many farmers who have been battling with TB year after year, I am
not at all sure what Jim will decide to do. Ours is an ideal farm for producing
468

grass-fed suckled beef, but the cattle, although descended from my original
cows, are not pedigree and therefore not irreplaceable. I should be sorry to see
them go, but I should quite understand if Jim, who I know feels that culling
badgers is a very last resort, were to give up livestock altogether and plough
up the whole farm, putting it into wheat or perhaps miscanthus or even more
trees.
I suspect there are many other farmers thinking along exactly these lines.
And for DEFRA Secretary, Hilary Benn, the crunch has finally come. Whatever
he decides in the next few weeks may well shape the future of the livestock
industry in the coming years. He has stated that in making a decision, he
will take into account four things – the science, the impact on the disease,
the practicalities, and public acceptability. Every farmer knows that public
acceptability is all he is really concerned about. The science is clear. Professor
Bourne’s culling trials proved conclusively that badgers do infect cattle with
TB, something that has been hotly denied for years by the Badger Trust, but
is now suddenly never questioned.
The 1970s showed that if culling is done effectively, that is by gassing on
individual farms, the impact on the disease is dramatic and does not result in
an increased incidence of infection in the locality. The practicalities - the use
of cyanide, is no longer an issue, since carbon monoxide is now an acceptable
alternative. Which leaves Benn to make the decision. Or are we governed by
public opinion, cleverly manipulated by single-issue pressure groups?

March 5th
How Can Youngsters Get Going?
Much is said these days about the problems for first time buyers looking for
a house, especially in rural areas. For young farmers hoping to get onto the
bottom rung of the farming ladder, the situation is even bleaker. A few years
ago, with agriculture going through a particularly bad time for anyone with
limited acres, I was quite optimistic that new entrants might get a start on land
not required by affluent city dwellers buying up old farmhouses.
Now however, with a glimpse at last of better prices for farm produce on the
horizon, land values seem to be rocketing. It may be that the new landed gentry
wish to enjoy the seclusion that 60 or 70 acres brings, or possibly it is because
neighbouring farmers see it as a last chance to make their farms big enough
to ensure survival, but you have only to open any newspaper at the farmsfor-sale pages, to be staggered at the prices being asked for quite small farms,
sometimes on difficult or hilly land - £1million plus as often as not. Any hope
469

2008
for new young blood coming into farming must be fading fast, which I reckon
is as damaging to the industry in the long run, as all the talk of vanishing rural
skills we keep hearing about.
I was very lucky when I started farming that there were opportunities which
do not exist today. Although farms to rent, the easiest way to get started,
were becoming increasingly difficult to find, there were many that had always
been tenanted, but which, having been purchased by the retiring farmers from
their landlords, were for sale on the open market. Some of these farms were
badly run down, with land that had been allowed to revert to wilderness in the
depression of the 1930s, so that the value per acre could be as little as one third
that of neighbouring land in good heart. This gave scope for a considerable
increase in value after a few years hard graft, which, together with a general air
of optimism in the industry, made it easier to get mortgages or bank loans on
reasonable terms.
There was a little more to it than that in my case, but it is surprising to
think that at the tender age of twenty-three, I was the owner, in partnership
with a fellow university graduate, of a 120 acre farm in deepest Devon, with a
100% mortgage at 4% interest. What money we could scrape together was used
to pay for the eleven Guernsey cows, two sows, a tractor and some implements
that came with the farm, and with that we started out to make a go of it. I
have friends and acquaintances who came into farming around that time, who
I am sure never regretted it and who in many cases have contributed much to
the wellbeing of farmers in the region.
I was also fortunate landing up in this part of North Devon. Perhaps the
farming community was as hospitable in those days everywhere in the Westcountry, but I could not have been made more welcome. We had only been here
a few weeks when a neighbour requested help for a day’s threshing, so I duly
trotted over first thing on the morning in question. There was quite a gang of
us, including local farmers, the farm staff and the threshing contractors. Come
midday, we all repaired to the farmhouse kitchen for the customary threshing
dinner, not to be taken lightly, with the culinary skills of the farmer’s wife on
the line.
It was also the time for the latest gossip to be aired at length, which I
expected would give me a chance to ingratiate myself with the locals. However
to my dismay, the conversation was in such broad Devonshire dialect that I
could barely understand a word that was said. For probably the first and only
time in my life, I sat tongue-tied throughout the meal. Getting back to work,
I confessed to the middle-aged chap, with whom I had been pitching sheaves
from the top of the corn rick all morning, the reason for my embarrassment. I

presumed a clever-dick college-boy was too much of an opportunity to pass up.
He said not to worry - they were just having a joke at my expense. I must have
passed muster. He was a Cornishman, who later became my father-in-law, and
I was asked to be godfather to my threshing neighbour’s firstborn daughter.

Threat to Smaller Abattoirs
I am happy to say that we got through our TB herd test last week unscathed.
Ten years ago such an event would scarcely have merited a mention, even if
we had had one or two reactors. These days the prospect of finding ourselves
faced with repeated tests through the coming months and possibly joining the
many farms where TB proves difficult to eradicate, doesn’t bear contemplating.
Let us hope that in a year’s time when our next test is due, the ministry have
finally devised a policy that will see this ruinous disease brought under control.
At least we are avoiding the trouble and expense of pre-movement TB testing
of cattle, which seems to be the forlorn best DEFRA can do to restrict the spread
of the disease. Since going organic, Jim has aimed at becoming completely selfsufficient, growing all our own feed, with only minerals and some bedding straw
bought in. He has stopped selling store cattle, and all the bullocks, as well as
the lambs, are now being fattened on the farm and sold direct to an abattoir.
In the last two years, with the movement restrictions that the various diseases
imposed on the industry, this has been a blessing, since movement direct to
slaughter has always been available. It certainly avoids the situation we got
into during the FMD outbreak in 2001, when we were stuck for weeks with
too many animals on the farm, a shortage of fodder and relying on bought-in
concentrates.
Not that buying-in concentrates at the moment, especially organic concentrates, is much of an option with the price currently sky-high. What has made
the difference over the last three years has been the feed value of the big-bail
silage from our red clover leys. Switching over from clamp silage to big bales
has certainly produced some hefty contractors bills, but it does make it easy
to select the better silage for the fattening animals, leaving the bales from the
permanent grass, all of which should have ended up as hay if the weather had
been kinder, going to the already well-fleshed suckler cows.
Actually, fattening the cattle on the red clover silage has gone almost too
well. Forty animals have been housed all winter getting silage, plus a small
amount of rolled corn. A month ago, the best seven were dispatched to the
abattoir at Bodmin, which is our nearest outlet for organic beef. They averaged
471

2008
300 kilos, which was satisfactory, but to our surprise, four of the seven were
graded as over fat, resulting in a very substantial reduction in value. We have
another batch that will be ready in a week or so, and it will be interesting to
see how they turn out.
Never let it be said that I am disputing the impartiality of the graders, but I
did assume we were producing exactly what Tesco, and therefore the discerning
beef eating public, wanted – extensively suckler-reared grass-fed organic-assured
Angus beef. Years ago, when we were supplying the abattoir at Torrington,
(now unfortunately closed down and mothballed), any problems would have
been dealt with by a trip to check the animals for ourselves and a discussion
with the graders to put things right. I am sure the Bodmin abattoir would be
just as welcoming, but the prospect of taking time out to drive halfway across
Cornwall is somewhat daunting.
It seems extraordinary that in a livestock-producing county as big as Devon
there is, so far as I am aware, no abattoir that has an organic contract with a
supermarket. In fact, there is only one medium-sized abattoir of any significance
left, the one at Hatherleigh, where we used to take our lambs. Tesco require
our organic lambs to travel to South Wales, so checking the grading is virtually
impossible. What is far more serious, particularly from a welfare aspect, is
this progression to fewer and larger abattoirs, resulting in animals having to be
transported ever-greater distances.
And the situation is only likely to get worse. If the Food Standards Agency
succeeds in its latest proposal to recover the full cost of hygiene inspections from
meat-processing plants, it could be the end for the half a dozen small abattoirs
remaining in Devon. Will the next thing be a bill from DEFRA every time one
of their inspectors visits the farm?

Pigmen Need Support
It is an absolute disgrace that our pig farmers are being allowed to go the
wall with nothing more than a few limp platitudes from the Government. The
latest example came during the ‘Questions to DEFRA’ debate in the House
of Commons last week. Henry Bellingham, conservative MP for Kings Lynn,
asked the Secretary of State, Hilary Benn, if he was aware that 70 per cent. of
imported pigmeat is produced in conditions that would be illegal in this country.
“What can the Minister do” Mr Bellingham wanted to know “to ensure that
consumers in this country are properly informed?” And answer came there none.
472

Mar 19th

Pigmen Need Support

Mr Benn made some sympathetic noises about the difficulties facing pig
farmers, but he avoided any reference to the conditions under which imported
pigmeat was produced. He supported the campaign that the industry is running
“to encourage consumers to be aware of the problems that face the pig industry
in Britain; to choose to buy bacon and pork from Britain; and to have the
information that enables consumers to exercise that choice”. That, he said, was
where the solution lies. But of anything he could do to ensure consumers were
properly informed, there was no mention.
A situation where laws can be passed imposing welfare conditions under
which animals are reared for food in the UK, while at the same time letting
similar foodstuffs be imported freely without any constraint whatsoever, is a
farce and everybody knows it. The animal welfare organisations, which are
responsible for pushing these regulations, hide behind the proposition that our
livestock farmers should set an example. They choose to ignore the obvious consequence that, in difficult times, cheaper imported animal products inevitably
replace our own, thus greatly increasing the number of animals being reared under the very conditions they object to. In this particular aspect of their work,
they are a disgrace and certainly do not deserve charitable status. At the very
least, they could mount a vigorous campaign for food labelling to highlight in
bold letters on all imported meat products the fact that these may not conform
to our higher welfare standards. Hilary Benn is obviously not going to bother.
Food labelling is a mess. Thinking about it while cooking my morning porridge – one of my rare accomplishments in the kitchen – I carefully read the
blurb on the packet of “Scott’s Porage Oats”, currently my favourite brand.
I have always assumed that the oats it contained were grown in Scotland. A
picture of a brawny Scott in a kilt putting the shot certainly covers the front of
the packet, together with the words ‘The true taste of Scotland’ and ‘Original
Scottish-milled oats’, but nowhere among the recipes and nutritional information does it say where the oats actually come from. All I can find is an assurance
that “Scott’s Porage Oats” have been milled in Scotland since 1880 in a distinctive way and signed A&R Scott – presumably the name of the business.
Admittedly, I don’t really mind where the oats are grown – I trust the good
name of the proprietors not to source them from newly felled rain forests. But
it has rather dampened the mental picture I have of a field of gently swaying
oats ready for harvest somewhere in the Highlands. Reaching into the fridge for
the carton of double cream (a tiny ‘little red tractor’ just visible) to enhance
my breakfast, I spotted a bottle of Soy Sauce. Here was something obviously
imported. Sure enough it is made in Hong Kong, but with no mention of where
473

2008
the main ingredient, soyabeans, are grown. Since so much of the world supply
is now GM, I am viewing the bottle with a very jaundiced eye.
In case I am giving the impression of being party political, let me hasten
to add that the Tories do no better in office. They are currently promising to
slash the plethora of farm regulations if returned at the next election. They
conveniently forget that Selwyn Gummer, when farm minister in the 1990s,
criticised our European partners for failing to enforce farm regulations properly.
He had Brussels, in retaliation, checking in detail what we were doing, which
frightened our officials into gold-plating every regulation in sight - something
we’ve been saddled with ever since.

Paying Organic Prices
It’s about time we had some prolonged spring weather. March came in with
violent gales, strong enough to cause damage to our woodland had the trees
been in leaf. But with repeated spells of frosty nights and wet and windy
days, the month is not going out like the proverbial lamb and nothing much
is growing. Fortunately we have plenty of silage to take us through to turnout
when that eventually comes, although we have had to order one more load of
straw for bedding.
Meanwhile lambing is finished for another year, with an active lot of little
lambs gambolling as usual outside my window, and spring calving has just
begun. In our old pre-organic days, this would have been the right moment to
get the fertiliser spinner out and apply our annual top-dressing of nitro-chalk
to all the grass ground. But not now - it is one job avoided and with the
exorbitant price to which fertiliser has risen in the past year, perhaps it’s just
as well. However I do have a sneaking feeling that, after all the recent wet
weather, we may be facing a dry summer - in which case getting everything
growing quickly would be a big advantage.
Our triticale certainly looks as if it could do with some nitrogen. Admittedly
it was sown in less than perfect conditions but it does seem to have suffered
from poor germination. That may not be a fault of the organic seed, which we
had some difficulty obtaining thanks to the bad harvest weather of last summer
– but it is not something we have been troubled with in the past. Nor has the
red-clover ley, which was also sown last autumn, turned out as well as hoped.
The establishment in this case is good, but the red-clover content is far less
than in the leys we planted three years ago before going organic – using nonorganic seed. Since expensive certified-organic seeds mixtures are only obliged
474

Mar 26th

Paying Organic Prices

to contain 65% organic seed, why all the bother? I have yet to discover if it
is possible to detect any real difference between what is grown organically and
what is not.
Come to that, I am still not convinced about this phobia against using inorganic nitrogen as a plant fertiliser. The high priests of the organic movement
will accuse me of heresy, but being a relative newcomer, I prefer to make up my
own mind. There are plenty of natural mineral fertilisers, as well as organic manures, that are employed regularly in organic farming to replace nutrient losses.
It is my understanding that so-called inorganic nitrogen fertiliser is manufactured using methane, or natural gas as it is called when piped into our houses.
Scientists have used it for nearly 100 years to combine with the atmosphere,
which comprises 80% nitrogen, in producing anhydrous ammonia, the basis of
most nitrogen fertilisers. One of these, urea, actually includes carbon dioxide,
that notorious destroyer of our climate, in its production. Methane is itself a
potent greenhouse gas, but is mainly derived from rotting vegetation or belching cows, which sounds pretty organic to me. Can nitrogen manufactured in
this way and used as a fertiliser for growing food be seen as part of an essential
cycle, possibly benefiting the planet rather than harming it?
I am not suggesting that this form of nitrogen should be flung around as
indiscriminately as we have in the past. But it could surely be included in
organic farming when applied accurately in conjunction with lime, instead of
relying so heavily on nitrogen fixing clovers. If organic farming is to play a part
in feeding a massively overcrowded world, it has to at least remain profitable.
There are already signs that, with the current escalation in food prices, people
are perhaps becoming reluctant to pay over the odds for organic produce. It is
apparent in the premium we receive for our beef and lamb, which has declined
markedly in the last twelve months. It was averaging at over forty per cent, but
for beef is currently down to under thirty, presumably a reflection of demand.
For lamb, the premium is now less than ten per cent, at which price it may
be more sensible to revert to selling our lambs as traditional, using our local
abattoir at Hatherleigh, rather than sending them on the long journey to South
Wales for very little extra return.

Giving Lisbon a Chance
I recently received a rather strange email. It explained how I could get in touch
with my MP to threaten him with the loss of my vote at the next General
election if he didn’t support a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. That was a
month ago, just before the debate in the House of Commons on the subject.
The email came from someone I hardly know, but who has my name in his email
address book. He urged me to pass on his email to all my contacts as quickly
as possible. We live in a strange world where so many people can be reached
almost instantly.
Of course, I did nothing of the sort. For one thing, I have met my MP on a
few occasions and I know he would take not the slightest notice of a threat like
that - in fact, I wouldn’t vote for him if he did. For another, I do not believe in
referenda – they are a waste of money, unless the matter is too big to be settled
by a general election. In this instance, I wonder how many who are actually
in favour of the Lisbon Treaty, or who couldn’t care either way, would bother
to vote. The silent majority simply does not turn out in support of the status
quo. It also surprises me how many people automatically assume that because
I am a farmer, living in the countryside, I must be anti-common market, pro
fox hunting and a committed Tory.
Strange as it may seem, I have always believed strongly in the idea of a
European Community. Unfortunately what we have at present is not working
anything like as well as it should, but if the Lisbon Treaty can improve things,
then for goodness sake let’s give it a go. While I am not qualified to pontificate
in general on the achievements or failures of the EU, I can’t help reflecting
on the fortunes of the euro. When it was introduced seven years ago and
we were considering whether the UK should join, those against the idea were
going around calling it a ‘mickey-mouse’ currency and predicting its imminent
failure, followed by the inevitable collapse of the whole European dream. Where
are those jeremiahs now? The euro has recently been going from strength to
strength, and it seems highly likely that, if the US dollar continues to fall, the
euro could well take over as the main world reserve currency.
When it comes to the effect that our membership of the EU has had on
agriculture, like any farmer I am in a much better position to judge. I have no
doubt that had we remained outside, UK farming would have been thrown by
governments of whatever colour onto the scrap heap, to join those other basic
industries - steel, coal mining and fishing, the latter hanging on by a thread
but fast disappearing. Agriculture has survived because the Common Agricul476

Apr 9th

Biofuels Debate Rages on

tural Policy has taken it out of the hands of our Whitehall masters. During
the days of butter-mountains and wine-lakes, cheap European food surpluses
would surely otherwise have been dumped on our markets. The wine we might
have managed, but food production here would probably by now have become
extremely specialised or non-existent.
It is only a couple of years since Gordon Brown, as Chancellor, was bemoaning the huge cost to Britain of supporting European farmers, echoing the calls
by anti-marketeers that the money could be better spent at home. The fact
that a large proportion was returning to keep our farming afloat is conveniently
overlooked. Thanks to that, our own food security, which the politicians are at
last taking seriously and which the CAP was designed to protect, may just be
realised.
When the history of the last 30 years of British agriculture comes to be
written, I have no doubt the role the CAP has played will be seen as hugely
beneficial. The financial support we received from Europe, something our own
government might have ducked, got us through the BSE catastrophe. The big
decisions such as the introduction of milk quotas and arable set-aside, which
many of us objected to at the time, may well prove to have been the only workable way of moving to unsubsidised food production. It is the small decisions –
like straight bananas, metric measures, and now recently, fresh mince, that get
all the headlines. And it is as much our fault as Brussels that these ever surface
before they are properly finalised.

April 9th
Biofuels Debate Rages on
Just as farmers were beginning to think we could make a real contribution to
saving the planet by growing biofuels, along comes a senior chemist to say the
idea has no practical future and would be taking us up an energy blind alley.
According to Dr Richard Pike, chief executive of the Royal Society of Chemistry,
it would require an area of farmland the size of thirty football pitches to produce
the 80 tons of kerosene needed to power just one airliner once a year, one way
across the Atlantic to New York. Even town dwellers can easily visualise the
size of a football pitch, which makes this a pretty evocative way of getting his
message across, but I wonder exactly where Dr Pike is leading us.
Since there is no other obvious fuel source at present capable of powering
aircraft in a form that can be carried in flight, Dr Pike seems to be implying
that we have to stick with fossil fuels for the foreseeable future. Thirty football
pitches would take up an area of about 70 acres, which when used to produce
477

2008
wheat, could yield enough to make approximately half a million loaves of bread.
Even farming organically, without the use of nitrogen fertilizer, this amount of
land would produce nearly a third of a million loaves. If Dr Pike believes in
climate change, you would expect him to use figures like these to urge us to fly
less, rather than reducing food production to ease our consciences, as we enlarge
our airports, jamming up new state-of-the-art baggage handling facilities with
the huge amount of luggage we insist on carting round the globe.
With the legal requirement that from this month the fuel we put in our
vehicles must contain at least 2.5 per cent of biofuels, environmental scientists
and green groups are suddenly jumping up and down voicing their misgivings.
They claim to be worried about the possibility that this may do more damage to
the climate than continuing to use undiluted fossil fuel. Once again the experts
are demonstrating their remarkable ability to disagree with each other on the
best way to produce clean energy. I am still totally unclear about whether we
should be sticking wind farms on every hill top, if a Severn barrage is a viable
option, or nuclear power our only hope for the future. We haven’t quite reached
the stage of running about like headless chicken, but we are getting dangerously
close.
On biofuels, the Government must stick to its guns and see how things turn
out – we cannot stop-start a new technology and hope to develop it successfully.
With transport responsible for 25 per cent of greenhouse emissions, the only
alternative is to cut down on our use of cars, lorries and planes, and there is no
indication that we are prepared to do that – in fact quite the reverse, scientists
and green groups included. We seem to be subconsciously accepting James
Lovelock’s pessimistic forecast that from 2040, global warming will accelerate
rapidly, that although it is manmade, it is already too late to do anything
about it. Dr Lovelock does however make the point that we should be thinking
seriously about safeguarding our ability to produce food.
For that reason alone, it is worth continuing with biofuels, whatever the
arguments about its immediate use. I am in no position to question Dr Pike’s
calculation that 70 acres of land is sufficient to produce 80 tons of kerosene, but
assuming that is correct, as fossil fuel becomes prohibitively more expensive, we
should be able to grow on our own farms all the fuel needed to power our tractors
at a reasonable cost. I believe on-farm production is already well advanced
in Germany, but, as usual, we are in danger of falling behind. To complete
the picture, the Chancellor must be persuaded to keep his sticky fingers from
levying any tax on fuel grown and used solely on farm. The rest of society may
eventually have to get on its bike, but going back to horse power on farms will
never feed the nation.

Should We Be Growing to Feed Humans or Pets?

April 16th
Should We Be Growing to Feed Humans or Pets?
I woke up to the sound of six different bird species singing outside the window”
was the answer I got to my enquiry about how well a friend had slept. Paul was
staying with us overnight on his way to an early sports event at which he was
officiating in Plymouth last Sunday. It was the first time he has visited us and
as a keen bird enthusiast, he had been hoping to see one of our nesting barn owls
setting off on its evening hunting round. Unfortunately he was disappointed,
although we did hear its hissing call after dark. However, he waxed lyrical about
the wide variety of bird life we have on the farm and wondered if we realise how
lucky we are.
Paul reckons he spends £15 a month on birdseed to attract birds into his
garden in Manchester. He presumes we never need to do anything like that. I
confess I have never spent a penny on bird food, and apart from tossing the
farmyard sparrows an occasional handful of rolled corn when feeding the cattle in
winter, or putting out some kitchen scraps in particularly hard weather, I don’t
believe it is helpful to distort the natural balance of bird species around the farm.
Obviously it is different if you live in a town, but supplying birds throughout the
year in the countryside with large amounts of exotic birdseed may well soften
up the ability of some species to survive through difficult times, while crowding
out other species that are quite capable of looking after themselves.
It is always a pleasure when visitors appreciate the wildlife we have on the
farm and hopefully Paul will come again, perhaps when there are young barn
owls clamouring to be fed. But I was left with the thought of that £15 he is
spending every month. It conjures up a TV picture of a small African child,
pot-bellied and large-eyed, standing in the Dafur desert with the caption that
£1 would feed this child for a month. I have no doubt it has also crossed Paul’s
mind and he is probably far more charitable than I am when confronted with
these appeals. But I worry that those of us living in affluent societies have lost
all sense of proportion when it comes to spending money feeding wild birds while
there are children somewhere in the world starving. It would be interesting to
know how much the wild-bird food industry is worth and whether the RSPB
has a conscience about supporting it.
And it goes much further than that. Think of the acres of supermarket shelfspace that are taken up with pet-food. Is it all unfit for human consumption
and only manufactured from food-waste that would otherwise go to landfill?
I have never noticed anything to that effect on the labels, in fact one of the
leading brands claims, in bold letters, that its dog food is made from fresh meat.
479

2008
Looking at the list of other ingredients, there is nothing obviously preventing it
from being used in a curry, thus masking any deficiencies in flavour. No doubt
the Food Standards Agency would insist on a health warning if it were unfit,
but that would hardly be in the interests of the manufacturer - it could well act
as a turnoff to the many pet lovers who see their little Fido as one of the family.
I think I am right in saying that sales of pet-food substantially exceed sales of
organic produce in the UK. Out of consideration for the many hungry people
on the planet, should we be setting an example to other rich nations and make
it illegal to feed dogs and cats on anything other than the scraps left over from
our dinner plates? That might usefully absorb much of the obscene wastage of
perfectly good food that is costing local authorities vast sums to dispose of.
The question is even more relevant now that world food supplies are reaching
a limit and prices are going through the roof. Food riots in places as far apart
as Haiti, the Philippines and Egypt have got the International Monetary Fund
talking of a global food crisis and the subject will head the agenda at the next
G8 summit in Tokyo. The time may not be too far off when we shall all have
to decide between feeding wild birds and household pets and feeding ourselves.

April 23rd
Vegetarian Claims Are Erroneous
I can think of no good reason that would persuade me to become a vegetarian,
especially after attending the Devon Cattle Breeders’ Society Annual Dinner, at
which Jenny and I were guests last week. Anyone who has never eaten a piece
of decent grass-fed beef, hasn’t lived – words that were probably first uttered
by prehistoric man as he hunted wildebeest on the African savannah.
I am somewhat disturbed, therefore, that the Vegetarian Society is using the
concerns about climate change to frighten people off eating meat. While it is
fully entitled to stand up for its belief that eating animals is immoral, unhealthy
or even unnatural, I draw the line at the rather sweeping generalisations about
greenhouse gas emissions, factory farming and land-use with which it is now
furthering its case. Our DEFRA Minister, the vegetarian Hilary Benn, has
asked us to judge him by what he does and not by what he eats, but seeing
his obvious preference for the environmental side of his brief, I hope he doesn’t
swallow too readily the slogan “Why it’s green to go vegetarian”, currently
figuring on the Society’s website.
It makes two specific claims to which I take particular exception. First, that
cattle require approximately 7 kg of grain to generate 1 kg of beef. This may
be true of very intensively fattened cattle, but it ignores the fact that much of
480

Apr 23rd

Vegetarian Claims Are Erroneous

our beef is not produced in this way. With the huge rise in world grain prices,
it is quite probable that the use of whole grain in livestock rations may soon
decline sharply for economic reasons. Out of interest, I worked out that we fed
less than 2 kgs of grain, in our case homegrown oats, to our cattle including the
breeding animals, for each kilogram of beef produced on the farm during the
last twelve months. It was not the best of summers for producing good quality
fodder, but I reckon that in a favourable season we could reduce this figure even
to the point of using no grain at all. Admittedly, we do need straw for bedding
and, in an organic system, for producing farmyard manure, so to that extent
grain farming is involved in our beef production, but unless straw is used in
future as a fuel or an industrial raw material, it should always be available as a
by-product of the food industry.
Second, the claim that someone living on a vegetarian diet in the UK requires
less than half the area of land to grow their food than someone following a
conventional diet. Now I have no way of refuting that from personal experience,
but I would certainly challenge it. Many years ago, we had a family farming
the neighbouring farm who were vegans. They kept no livestock at all and
they avoided wearing clothes which used wool or leather. They were, in fact,
the ultimate vegetarians, since eating eggs or dairy products inevitably involves
farming animals. We were sometimes invited to a meal, but although nut-based
main courses are certainly interesting, if not quite to my taste, I found I was
hungry again within a very few hours. And therein lies the problem with a
vegan diet. Probably sufficient for office workers, but not much use for those of
us working out of doors, for sportsmen, growing children and pregnant women,
without eating a lot more food. A good roast beef dinner and I can happily
survive twenty-four hours and longer, which takes me neatly back to our evening
out last week.
If ever a breed of cattle merited the title of the best tasting beef of old
England, it is the Red Ruby Devon. It has evolved through selective breeding
over many generations to do precisely what the green lobby is demanding of
farmers today – that is to produce food efficiently while maintaining the natural
environment, in this case the wetter grassy uplands of North Devon.
Judging from the turn out at their dinner, with over 120 people present,
the Devon Cattle Breeders’ Society is certainly flourishing. There was a good
mixture of the older farming families, who have been breeding Red Rubies on
farms mentioned in the original herd book of 1884, and new comers to the
breed. Following their record-breaking sale of breeding stock earlier this spring,
I’ll wager the Society will be adapting to whatever the climate can throw at us
long after the idea of a purely vegetarian diet is forgotten.

April 30th
Flowers Without Directives
This past week has at last seen some proper April weather – sunshine, showers
and a bit of warmth - and not before time. The winter has been notable only
in it’s determination to hang on for as long as possible, with persistent night
frosts keeping grass growth to a minimum. Which is surprising considering that
we are being treated to the most brilliant display of primroses in the hedgerows
that I can recall. Our bluebells are about to bloom, so I am hoping it will be a
special year for them as well.
However the fact that we have an abundance of blue bells and primroses
on the farm is not only due to the vagaries of the weather. The presence or
otherwise of these two magical spring flowers is undoubtedly linked to the way
the farm has been managed over generations. Farmers here before us have
always used woods as shelter and grazing for cattle, curbing the brambles and
giving the bluebells daylight. And by allowing hedges to grow up for fifteen or
more years, before laying them in rotation, but keeping the banks on which they
grow (especially the roadside ones) pared tightly back, the primroses flourish
as if in coppiced woodland.
These practices were not adopted for the sake of the flowers. They developed
as the easiest ways to manage the environment for the mixed pastoral farming in
this area of Devon. And as a newcomer with limited capital in the early 1950s, it
was only natural to copy what obviously worked locally, which was not always
quite as it was done in Sussex, where I came from. Nowadays, it seems to
be environmental grants and ministry regulations that dictate what wildlife is
expected to flourish in farmland, instead of allowing it to evolve naturally, as it
used to do. The diversity of our English counties is becoming distinctly blurred
at the edges.
The way things are going, I should not be in the least surprised if the shape
of the countryside changes even more radically in the future. Fifty years ago, the
value of the farmable land was all that really mattered, whether owned or rented.
The hedges, woodland and even the farmhouses were either an inducement or
a liability when deciding to take a farm. As time passed, the price of houses,
especially in rural areas, went through the roof, and the value of the farmhouse
itself became the main consideration. The land was almost incidental and often
sold off to a local farmer.
Now suddenly, the value of the land itself has taken on a life of its own. I
see that bare land, with no house or buildings, has risen to as much as £7,000
an acre in recent sales in the Westcountry. The rent equivalent doesn’t bear
482

May 7th

Time Now to Dump Minister

thinking about, and with costs rising faster than food prices, the average farmer
hoping to expand on borrowed capital just now must be having second thoughts.
I gather it is City money and overseas investors that are driving the land market,
led by buyers from Denmark and Ireland.
I confess the possibility of the Danes and the Irish buying up large tracts of
English farmland does fill me with some foreboding. We had a bad experience in
the mid 60s when a Dane bought the neighbouring farm. He was newly arrived
from what was then called Rhodesia, having accepted a generous compensation
package for abandoning his land out there. He was nice enough, but made it
clear from the outset that he would show us Devon yokels how to farm. He may
have been trying to transplant a slice of Africa to the North Devon countryside,
but he returned to his native Denmark after a very few years. Unfortunately
by then, he had, without our knowledge, channelled a winter’s production of
cow slurry directly into the trout-breeding stream that bounded our properties,
turning it into an open sewer.
He would not have got away with it today and I am sure Danish and Irish
farmers are not all like that, but lifestyle farming investors would do well to
remember that when serious food shortages have threatened in the past, governments have not hesitated to impose draconian controls on how the land is
managed.
And unfortunately on those occasions, bluebells and primroses come very
low down in the general scheme of things.

May 7th
Time Now to Dump Minister
I am often asked if I have any difficulty thinking of something new to write
about each week. Actually, in recent years, farming has faced so many ups
and downs, mostly downs, that I am generally spoilt for choice. This week is
no exception, and I was contemplating whether to comment on the National
Trust’s refusal to allow badger culling on its land - or the possibility that we
may get a supermarket ombudsman with some teeth - or the fact that blue
tongue vaccine is available ahead of time - or even that DEFRA has once again
managed to issue farmers with two new 40-page must-read instruction booklets
to complete this years Single Payments Forms, while apparently struggling to
finish paying some of us what we are owed from last year.
And then over the weekend, Gordon Brown makes a throw away remark in a
TV interview about the damage the recent local elections results have inflicted
on the government’s credibility. The Prime Minister claimed to be aware of the

worries ordinary people have about the economy, and in outlining the various
measures he intends to take to put things right, he said he would tackle higher
food prices. Which is something I simply cannot pass without comment. How
on earth does he think he can do anything about that?
Just as I was thinking that Gordon Brown was at last beginning to appreciate the value of having an agricultural industry capable of feeding the nation, he
says something that makes one wonder whether he understands the least thing
about farming. As Chancellor for the last ten years, he has doggedly persisted
in voicing his dislike of the CAP, and the support mechanisms that went with it,
which enabled farmers to produce food at less than the cost of production. This
system is now on the way out, with support being redirected towards maintaining the countryside. But the Prime Minister must surely realise that had this
happened when New Labour first came to power, we would by now have no
agricultural industry left worth writing about. Or does he really think farmers
could have gone on producing food at a loss without bankrupting ourselves.
So I am very interested to hear what he is going to do now that the price of
food has risen to the actual cost of production. From all his recent preaching
about world food shortages and the threat of mass starvation, he knows better
than most that we are now farming in a world food economy at world prices. I
cannot believe that our ex-chancellor has undergone some kind of Damascene
conversion to the merits of food subsidies, funded by the taxpayer. Nor, surely,
can he suddenly overturn the Competition Commission’s newly announced proposals to establish fair trade between retailers and suppliers, and encourage the
supermarkets to revert to squeezing farmers till the pips squeak.
I had been looking forward to seeing what sort of Prime Minister our Gordon
would turn out to be. I was hoping for an old-fashioned, dour, media-intolerant
leader, far removed from his predecessor. Now, in order to survive the remaining
two years of this administration, he seems to be attempting to smile sweetly
at every passing interviewer, something that does not come naturally to him,
while trying to ignore the looming threat of a knife in the back. What we
really need, in my opinion, for the nation as well as the farming industry, is
a period of strong uncompromising decision-making, much as he handled the
economy. Mistakes may have been made – no politician is perfect – but at least
he never allowed public opinion in the shape of way-out fringe pressure groups
to interfere with his judgment.
If the Prime Minister is serious about food prices, he can make a start by
dumping Hilary Benn, who is turning out to be even feebler than Douglas Hogg
(which is saying something), and bring back David Miliband, who seems to be
doing nothing useful at the foreign office. He, at least, appeared to understand
484

Charlock Problems in Triticale

the shambles he had inherited from Margaret Beckett, but was never given
the time to put things right. He is also more than capable of standing up for
himself in cabinet, and might, just might, remove some of the obstacles that
are preventing us getting food production back to as near self-sufficiency as
possible, which is where we were a few short years ago.

May 21st
Charlock Problems in Triticale
There was a time when, with the Devon County Show behind us, I would now
be ruefully contemplating the prospect of ten days singling mangolds with a
hand-hoe. It was for me a tedious and backbreaking job that I never really
mastered, although there were some who seemed to enjoy the peace and quiet,
with just the occasional song of a skylark to break the monotony. But I was glad
when silage making supplanted root crops as the essential succulent winter-feed
for cattle.
Another tiresome manual job that regularly occurred through the summer
months was controlling weeds like docks and sow thistles, charlock and wild oats.
Chemical sprays put paid to all that and fieldwork these days rarely involves
getting off a tractor-seat. I doubt if many youngsters would contemplate a
career in farming if the amount of work we used to do by hand were still a
major part of it.
However, since going organic, the problem of weed control has reared its ugly
head once more, particularly the control of charlock. It was the one weed that
we were always prepared to have sprayed by a contractor if it showed up in a
cornfield. Reverting to rotational farming in good organic fashion, we ploughed
up a seventeen-acre field last autumn that has been in permanent pasture for
at least twenty years, assuming it would be free of arable weeds. Somewhat to
our surprise, the triticale, which after a slow start is now growing strongly, is
decorated with a considerable sprinkling of the yellow flowers of that pernicious
weed. We really haven’t the time to hand weed it, but that is what we should
be doing. Fifty years ago, it would have been possible to muster a gang from
the village who would think nothing of three or four days hand pulling, but not
today.
So I am not surprised that strawberry growers are finding it impossible to
find enough local workers willing to help with the harvest that is about to get
under way. If the job involved a self-starter or even a toggle to yank a two-stroke
engine into life, I doubt there would be a problem, but otherwise it is a case
of looking east to countries where farming is some generations behind us, and
485

2008
where people are still willing to bend their backs for a few weeks now and then
to make a living.
If the unthinkable happens and strawberries have to be rationed at Wimbledon, while fruit is rotting in the fields, there may well be a public outcry. The
government will be asked to explain why it was necessary to restrict migrant
workers from outside the EU this year, just as the seasonal workers from Poland
and other neighbouring countries are finding it more rewarding to stay home.
I don’t think the usual ministerial answer that it is “what the public wanted”,
which is trotted out on these occasions, will suffice. That it was really a kneejerk reaction to some bad press about uncontrolled immigration, an entirely
different problem, would be too embarrassing to admit.
Government policy seem to be increasingly made purely in the light of public
opinion, as judged by the strength of feeling in letters to the press, or emails
to ministers’ websites. A criminal example is the situation where a farmer
has to witness the slaughter of seventy-five perfectly healthy cattle in a vain
attempt to bring TB under control, but is denied the right to use his own
judgement to take out a single badger on his farm, when he is convinced that is
the source of the infection. For this decision even the Prime Minister is guilty
of hiding behind dodgy science, rather than risk admitting that the government
may have misjudged what most people really think - that farmers and vets
should be allowed to get on and do a job, about which only they have first-hand
knowledge based on past experience.
I see that the Chancellor has now joined in – making policy decisions on the
hoof, which are thought to be popular. He is publicly demanding that the CAP
is scrapped to suppress the rise in world food prices. Doesn’t he realise that
the CAP is all that has kept food prices as low as they have been for so long?
If he hangs on to his job, he may yet witness young financial wizkids having to
pick their own strawberries before taking time off to watch the tennis.

French Pay More for Diesel
A gale and driving rain is howling out of the east, as I write, but by tomorrow
we may all be enjoying the sunshine again. I am not completely convinced
about long-term climate change (the planet may be quite capable of regulating
itself given time), but certainly recent weather has been as changeable as in
any May I can recall. Surprisingly, it hasn’t prevented dairy farms round here
making what should turn out to be very good first-cut silage.
486

May 28th

French Pay More for Diesel

The speed with which the silage can be cut and cleared nowadays days is
certainly the crucial factor in beating catchy weather. Farms, which yesterday
had acres of grass waiting for silaging to begin, will by the day after tomorrow
be cut, cleared and safely stored, with field after field changing from dark green
to near white as if by the press of a button.
I was driving in a bit of a hurry along one of our better roads near here the
other day, when I found myself pulled up short facing one of the agricultural
behemoths responsible for this remarkable transformation. It looked even bigger than a combine harvester, which one doesn’t expect to see at silage time.
Certainly there was nowhere that two of them could have passed each other
on that particular stretch of country road. The queue of cars behind me had
to back up considerable distances to find suitable gateways to pull into and I
eventually drove on muttering, like any motorist, at the delay.
However what really got to me was the fact that silage harvesters this size
are fine in the wider counties to the east, but only really suitable on the largest
farms here in the southwest. An average farm like ours cannot take advantage of
such a machine to get the silage made quickly - the monster would not get into
our lane in the first place, let alone turn through any of our gateways. I quite
understood the sentiments of the driver, when he pointed out in the few words
we exchanged, that he couldn’t hope to complete the three thousand acres he
was contracted to do with a smaller machine.
Much as I might grumble about the difficulties for smaller farms with smaller
fields and narrow approach roads, I realise that farming will obviously remain
dependant for the foreseeable future on oil, either bio or fossil, for its motive
power. The cost of oil, therefore, is inevitably going to dictate what machinery
we can afford to use. Since agricultural diesel has nearly doubled in price in the
last twelve months and larger machines cover more acres in a given time using
less fuel per acre in the process, I suppose I must accept the inevitable.
Fuel costs may even have a bearing on the discussions taking place just now
over the so-called ‘health checks’ to the CAP. UK farmers are concerned that
any changes may continue to discriminate against us, for instance by allowing
headage payments to be retained for cattle and sheep in countries like France.
Before we make too much fuss, we would do well to take into account the fact
that farm diesel in France is currently about 20p a litre dearer than it is here.
It is impossible to achieve an absolutely level playing field, but the way fuel
prices are going, we may well have the overall advantage.
Where we have certainly gained an advantage over mainland Europe is the
good news that the bluetongue vaccine seems to have reached us before the
midges carrying the disease. Bluetongue caused havoc to sheep flocks in north487

2008
ern Europe last year with farmers able to do little except watch their animals
die. We can avoid this misery completely if we act quickly enough, although
it is absolutely vital we also vaccinate all our cattle, which, although possibly
suffering long-term health problems, often show few signs of infection. Unfortunately, unlike sheep, they need two jabs three weeks apart, which may encourage
farmers with animals on outlying land to dodge the job altogether.
At the risk of making myself extremely unpopular, I think I might have suggested that DEFRA should have made the vaccine more expensive and required
proof of purchase as a single farm payment cross-compliance condition. Farmers
rarely throw away something we have paid good money for. We can hardly rely
on the present gales to blow airborne midges halfway across the Atlantic.

June 11th
Profit of £100 in a Good Year
We are inundated these days by reports of every catastrophic event that takes
place anywhere in the world. Grim news pours into our homes in a steady
stream through TV, radio and the daily papers - pictures of an earthquake in
China, a typhoon in Burma, starving people in a parched desert or a suicidebombing in a crowded market. And the media manage to blend these disasters
with a leavening of lesser crises like the upsurge in knife-crime, the escalating
cost of fuel at the pumps or rising food prices.
I used to think that news was also supposed to be uplifting or even exciting
but I find all this doom and gloom ends up becoming boring, which is frankly
the last thing it should be. Actually, rising food prices may well be a crisis for
an unpopular government, but it is one of the few bits of news that did cheer
me up. It should really be seen as a wakeup call to the nation. If we are to
ensure that we have enough to eat, food has to be profitable to produce. The
way things were going in farming a year or so ago, UK food production would
have continued on its downward slide.
The last time agriculture in this country was abandoned completely to market forces, something that is being advocated in high places as a possible solution
today, was in the ’20s and ’30s. It resulted in the lowest level of home food production ever and the worst farming recession in living memory. I recently spent
an enjoyable afternoon chatting over a cup of tea with someone who recalls
those days well.
Stanley and Rita Hayes are semi-retired now, but still live on the farm where
Stanley was born in 1913. His father had taken the tenancy of the 120acre farm
in1911, and the war years that followed must have helped him get established.
488

Jun 11th

Profit of £100 in a Good Year

Stanley distinctly remembers the victory celebrations that took place in one of
their fields, the farm being central to the parish. After leaving school, he joined
his father working the farm. In those days 120acres was not a small farm – the
average size farm in Devon in 1931 was 65acres.
The main income was derived from the sale of store cattle at the local
livestock market at Thelbridge, within easy walking distance of the farm, and
fat lamb at the Lloyd Maunder slaughterhouse at Witheridge. Eggs and poultry
also went to Lloyd Maunder and the butter, produced from the twelve Devon
milking cows was sold to the Witheridge Butter Factory, a place I had never
heard of until the other day. The store cattle were generally bought by Sussex
dealers who took them on by train for fattening in the Home Counties. I don’t
think I am betraying a confidence when I mention that Stanley reckons it was
a good year if the farm made a profit of £100.
The farm was worked entirely by horses, a pair of handsome Shires, if the
photo is anything to go by. Stanley’s father, when he first came to the farm,
brought a horseman with him, who eventually on retirement handed over to the
son, clocking up between the two of them an astonishing 73 years employment.
There were no tractors on farms locally until the 1940s and the few cars belonged
to people like the doctor. Travelling was by horse and trap, restricting how far
one could go on a day away from work. Added to that was the complete lack of
any of today’s services – electricity, mains water, telephone, or even the wireless.
No weather forecasts or world news – just a local weekly paper and the gossip
on market day to keep in touch with events.
It is easy to assume that the pace of life was therefore more leisurely than
now, but I’m sure that for most of each year it must have been a hard slog
from daylight to dusk to keep ahead of the weather. You couldn’t afford to slow
down if work was governed by the walking pace of a Shire horse. However there
was a brighter side – no inspections by ministry men, no form filling, in fact no
paper work at all that Stanley can remember.
Many farmers went under, but the Hayes survived, buying their farm and
expanding a little when the last war came and eventually handing on to the
next generation. If I manage to reach the grand age of 95 and have as cheery a
smile as Stanley gave me walking me out to my car, I shall be well content.

Why Plant a Field of Chamomile?
It was a glorious sunny day and we were standing on a hill halfway between
Penzance and Lands End, among the relics of the ancient roundhouses of Carn
Euny. Half a mile away, down the valley, a tractor was baling meadow hay and
in an adjacent field the parallel green lines of newly emerging maize were just
showing. The sea was clearly visible in the distance as a narrow band of deeper
blue against a cloudless sky.
Jenny and I were taking a few days break following our visit to the Cornwall
County Show, which surpassed itself as usual. We don’t always get to the Show,
but we do make a habit these days of getting to western Cornwall every year
– the land of Jenny’s forebears on both sides of her family. Although born in
Devon, she’s as Cornish as they come and I am not allowed to forget it. Actually
I thoroughly enjoy our visits - there seem to be new places to see every time
we go, although this was not the first time we have been to Carn Euny. The
remains of the Iron Age village date back to pre-Roman times, but apparently
there was a Neolithic settlement here two or three thousand years before that.
It has an evocative atmosphere that makes it difficult not to feel surrounded
by the ghosts of the original farmers who lived here. On this occasion, I found
myself wondering what they would make of farming today.
The train of thought was due to the unusual crop that is growing on what I
assume was their arable field, the couple of acres directly in front of the ancient
village. It is the nearest piece of easily cultivable land on which to grow their
primitive varieties of wheat or barley. The last time we were there, it was a
small grassy meadow grazed by sheep, like the other land in the vicinity. Now
it seems to have been ploughed and sown to what appears to be chamomile,
and a very good take at that – thick, even and about four inches high. We
were intrigued to know what it was being grown for, but hadn’t the courage to
enquire at the neighbouring farm, since they were obviously busy haymaking.
I asked the only other visitor to Carn Euny if he could shed any light on it.
He couldn’t, but was very interested to know why farmers were not allowed to
grow Indian hemp, Cannabis indica, which he said was extremely rich in oil and
fibre, grew to five or six feet in a matter of weeks, and could be cropped twice
in a year. He seemed very knowledgeable about the crop, which in the days of
sail produced the rigging and broad cloth essential to Britain’s ability to rule
the waves. He suggested it should now be added to the list of plants being used
to replace mineral oil and he is probably right, but I would hesitate to assume
his opinion was due in any way to his ponytail and tattoo.

Missed Co-op Chances

Of all the changes that have occurred in farming over the millennia, perhaps
it is the huge variety of plants that have been domesticated and improved that
would most impress the ancients. I am sure they would quickly adapt to modern
methods of husbandry, but the choice of what to grow might well daunt them.
And what would certainly amaze them would be the fact that we are fast
running out of farmable land on which to produce enough food.
Only this week, the leader of the world’s most powerful nation has been
discussing with our Prime Minister the problem of soaring food and energy
prices, but was population control even on their agenda? Phrases like ‘six
billion people to feed by 2050’ occur frequently in the media, but is there any
reason to assume it will stop there? By that time, the cost of food and energy
will be the least of the world’s worries. The real problem is how to curb the
escalating number of people. Natural disasters appear to make very little impact
on the total. The saddest TV picture that will remain with me of the recent
earthquake in China was the sight of a woman waiting beside the ruins of a
school building to see if her teenage son had survived. He was her only child –
the only one she had been allowed to have during the attempt by the Chinese
government to bring their population under control. Our Neolithic ancestors
might find that the most extraordinary difference to their world.

June 25th
Missed Co-op Chances
I could hardly believe my eyes when I read last week that in future farmers in
Holland will be taking a cut out of the beef and lamb we produce here on our
farm. That is if we continue to sell our finished animals to St Merryn Meat, the
red meat processor based in Cornwall and South Wales, which I understood was
one of the main suppliers to Tesco. I rather naively assumed that if I happened
to be in Tesco and bought an organic steak, there was a chance I might be
getting beef that had originated from us. In fact I have been meaning to do
just that for some time now to see if we are getting a fair share of the end price.
I now realise I shall have to look into the matter more carefully. It is obviously not just a question of checking how much Tesco are charging or whether
St Merryn Meat has done a good job converting our bullock into a suitably tender and tasty piece of sirloin to grace a suburban barbecue. Apparently Vion,
the Dutch food giant, has acquired Grampian Country Foods for the trifling
sum of £350million. It so happens that Grampian controls a number of red
meat processors including St Merryn Meat, as well as it’s own pig and poultry
business, making it one of the main suppliers to our supermarkets.
491

2008
Vion, therefore, has ended up with a considerable stake in the UK livestock
industry. And who owns Vion? Why, a single shareholder – the Dutch farmers’ union, which represents 51,000 professional farmers and horticulturalists,
roughly 70% of the total in Holland. What have British farmers been doing
while all this has been going on? Well, there was a time years ago when we
cooperatively owned North Devon Meat, a state of the art abattoir near Torrington, which eventually through poor management ran into financial difficulties
and passed through a series of companies into the hands of St Merryn Meat.
We had our chance and blew it.
All the years I have been farming, agricultural pundits have been advocating
that the only sure way for farmers to make a decent living is to cooperate, not
necessarily in the day-to-day management of our farms, but certainly when
buying or selling. Unfortunately, while there have been some valiant attempts
over the years and there are examples of buying cooperatives that have been
extraordinarily successful, marketing cooperatives have had a very poor record.
Perhaps the Marketing Boards with their compulsory membership, which we
accepted as the only way out of the depression years of the 1930s, spoilt us
for the voluntary alternatives. The Milk Marketing Board, one of the most
successful, but Government controlled to avoid monopoly trading, was much
admired by communist Russia, giving one some idea of its possible shortcomings.
Thankfully there are signs that we are at last getting our act together, with
a number of farmer-owned cooperatives becoming major players in the marketplace, particularly for milk, cereals and horticultural products. But we have a
lot of catching up to do. I can remember when, forty years ago, there was talk
of Cornish and Breton vegetable growers collaborating to transport produce between the two regions. I am not aware of the details of why we backed off, but
the French farmers certainly went ahead on their own and joined up with the
North Finistere Chamber of Commerce to form Brittany Ferries. Look what a
successful company that has become, accounting for over half the ferry business
at this end of the English Channel, and transporting nearly three million passengers and a million vehicles every year. And the French farming co-operatives
are still the majority shareholders. This missed opportunity has always stuck
in my throat while enjoying a typically French meal in their splendid on-board
restaurants on our occasional holidays to the continent.
Perhaps it is not too late to get a slice of the action. Should I be enquiring
whether we qualify to belong to a French farm co-operative? After all, there
are supposed to be no restrictions to business between Member States. Better
still, since we don’t produce cauliflowers or artichokes for sale in Brittany, but

July 2nd
Risk of Exporting Cruelty
I have never been much of a fan of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall – for a start,
I find his TV programmes singularly lacking in humour. However, I have to
concede that his attempt to embarrass Tesco at its AGM last week into raising
the welfare standards of its intensively reared chicken does deserve credit. After
all, in this media-crazy age, there is a lot of mileage to be had in tilting at
windmills.
Becoming a shareholder in order to tackle a leading supermarket head-on and
succeeding in getting ten per cent of the vote to back his resolution against the
big moneymen, with their multiple shareholdings and little concern for anything
apart from the size of their dividend, is no mean achievement. If I wished to be
churlish, I might query Hugh’s apparent lack of research into the procedure of
the Tesco AGM, which resulted in his missing the deadline for putting forward
his resolution, and lumbering him and his backers with a thumping great bill
for £90,000 to get it included.
But where I really take issue with him is his proposal that Tesco should apply
the RSPCA’s “Freedom Food” marque as the minimum welfare conditions for
standard chicken. Just think of the implications if Tesco were to be saddled
with what is in effect an arbitrary standard, entirely at the discretion of the
RSPCA. This could be set to whatever level the RSPCA might consider popular
with its members. I’m sure it would deny that such an eventuality would ever
arise, but it’s a very short step to the welfare standards of all Tesco’s livestock
products being subject to the RSPCA’s governing body.
I do find it difficult to believe that an oven-ready bird can be produced
through all its stages from the incubation of an egg, to the brooding, rearing,
killing, dressing and packaging and still leave a profit at the sale price of a couple of quid as advertised recently by Tesco, without breaching existing welfare
regulations. The RSPCA, as a well-respected charitable organisation, is fully
entitled (I could say duty bound) to check if these chickens are being treated
cruelly and, if so, to bring the matter to the attention of the law.
If it considers our laws are not strict enough in defining cruelty, the RSPCA
surely has every right to campaign for change, provided it takes into account
the probability that this will inevitably export cruelty to those countries whose
livestock products will replace our own. It can even promote its own Freedom
493

2008
Food standard, although it then runs the risk that adverse publicity may damage
the very cause it is championing, as happened only the other day. The disclosure
that one of its Freedom Food farms had been found to have dead and dying
chicken in its poultry sheds, which the RSPCA had failed to monitor properly,
could not have come at a worse time. Better that the RSPCA sticks to its
original task of investigating cases of cruelty and lets the industry manage
livestock welfare as an essential part of good husbandry.
However, at this point, I have to confess to being concerned with the way
livestock farming is going. There was one comment in the press which implied
that if Tesco could get the economies of scale necessary to bring down the price
of free-range birds, all would be well. Is that really the answer? While I deplore
the sight of a shed crammed with intensively reared poultry, albeit for only the
last few days before slaughter, I am not entirely happy at the sight of so-called
free-range hens covering an enclosure in their hundreds like a flock of pigeons
on a field of kale. The pigeons are at least free to fly to another field, while the
poultry are stuck in their enclosure for weeks at a time.
Nor am I exactly ecstatic when I sometimes see a herd of dairy cattle so
thick on the ground that the grass is barely visible. Perhaps I am just old
fashioned, but I was brought up to believe that for animals to thrive, they
needed space. Thriving is too often these days not the word that immediately
springs to mind while watching a large herd crossing the road to milking. Here
in the Westcountry, our farms are simply not large enough for livestock to be
farmed in their thousands, and I believe we risk destroying our industry by
attempting to do so.

July 9th
Time to Return Swill Feed?
Well, well, well – so Gordon Brown has suddenly realised that here in Britain
we waste too much food, over four million tonnes a year apparently. He flies half
way round the world to Japan and announces something we have all been long
aware of. If the remaining platitudes to come out of the current G8 summit are
as perceptive, and the actions needed to resolve the world’s problems ignored as
usual until the next summit, his journey and the fuel used will also have been
wasted.
Why is the Prime Minister suddenly making a big issue of this? His suggestion that a shortage of food worldwide is putting up prices, but that taking
action to reduce waste could make for cheaper food in the long run is surely too
simplistic. Is he not aware that the real explanation for why we throw away so
494

Jul 9th

Time to Return Swill Feed?

much is actually because it’s too cheap and also apparently absurdly plentiful.
An alien entering any supermarket in the UK might well assume all food on
this planet grows on trees. I sometimes think there are people who suffer from
the same delusion, which is not surprising when you consider the way in which
these food emporiums operate. Cheap promotions (funded by the supplier to
ensure listing), buy-one-get-one-free (BOGOF as it is so aptly termed), and
special offers all encourage us to buy more than we need and eventually throw
away what we can’t eat.
When so many in the world go hungry, it is morally indefensible to waste
food for whatever reason. However to change our ways is going to take more
than a few pious words from Mr Brown. For the past thirty years, successive
governments have actively pursued a cheap food policy, encouraging imports
regardless of the decline in home production, forcing larger farms to become
more intensive and allowing smaller farmers to go to the wall. To balance the
environmental effect this has had on our countryside, farm ministers have taken
more notice of wildlife trusts, animal welfare charities and other so-called greens
on how we should go about growing our own food than they have of farmers.
That will have to change.
More than that, when it comes to buying food, we have been turned into a
nanny state. We are no longer expected to know what is good for us with everything rigidly proscribed by lab technicians in white coats. How many people
today trust their nose rather than going by the use-by-date when chucking food
in the bin? It is easy to carp, but what should we do about it?
As a rich nation, there is little likelihood of our returning to wartime rationing, a state of affairs when food waste was at an absolute minimum. I clearly
recall one boy at school, who would cheerfully eat any egg that was decidedly off
on our once-a-week one-boiled-egg-for-breakfast day. He never seemed to suffer
any ill effects, but no egg ever went back to the school kitchen. I am not suggesting we return to that, but there must be ways to overcome the use-by-date
problem. Surely food that is approaching this deadline could be progressively
reduced in price to a level at which there is no retail profit margin, rather than
the current practice of half price offers for food that has only one day as theoretically edible. Facing higher wholesale food prices, the superstores are already
squaring up to each other to protect their share of the market. We now have
a supermarket ombudsman so is this the time to consider making it illegal to
retail food at less than the cost of production, which I believe is the law in
Germany and France?
Modern food retailing is not the only source of waste. Nowadays, with
more and more people eating out, the food thrown away from what we leave
495

2008
in restaurants is nothing short of criminal. There was a time when all this was
directly recycled as pigswill, but not now. Farm animal disease outbreaks have
put paid to that most efficient use of discarded food, not because swill feeding
was in itself dangerous, but purely through inept government regulation of the
safeguards needed.
I suppose the real answer, apart from reducing waste to a minimum, is to
view it as a valuable raw material and, with Government help, use it profitably.
The last place it should end up is in landfill.

July 16th
Sunshine Needed to Make Hay
Halfway through the summer and we still haven’t made any hay. Are we ever
going to get away from this Noah’s Ark weather, with near-record rainfall for
the first half of July and frequent Met Office flood warnings? Perhaps that old
Elizabethan rhyme, which ends with the words “St Swithin’s Day if it be fair,
for forty days t’will rain no more”, will come to our rescue, although tomorrow’s
forecast (as I write) does not look too hopeful.
However, apart from haymaking, the weather hasn’t been all bad. Jim has
had a good first cut of red clover silage and the rain is ensuring a decent second
cut later on. It has also been good for young trees of which we have plenty, but
not apparently for the young elms in our hedges, which are left in the hope that
some may eventually survive to become mature trees. These are dying earlier
than usual and as much smaller trees at that. The common over-wintering
flashy butterflies like Small Tortoiseshells and Peacocks have been extremely
scarce and, for the first time that I can recall, I have been unable to find any of
their very-recognisable black spiky caterpillars on the patches of stinging nettles
left as their feed plant. Our buddleias, the shrubs so attractive to these species,
will soon be in flower, so we shall see if for some reason their numbers have
plunged.
And sadly, our last surviving colony of wild bees has finally succumbed.
Their hollow tree may eventually be recolonised by a swarm from a local beekeeper, but it won’t be quite the same. The wild colony was there before I
arrived – nearly sixty years ago.
On the plus side, this has been a bumper year for finches. We have an
old round granite pig trough in our front garden, which makes a well-protected
drinking place for birds, particularly fledglings. I have never before seen so
many young bullfinches, greenfinches, chaffinches and goldfinches arriving early
each day to quench their thirst – a very colourful sight indeed. That other

Sunshine Needed to Make Hay

rather drab finch, the house- sparrow has also had a good breeding year – the
farm buildings seem to be swarming with them.
There may be other unusual changes in the wildlife on the farm, but I have
only recently been taking note of fluctuations like these since farmers became
the whipping boys for every apparent decline in a particular plant or animal.
There is probably a simple weather-induced explanation this year for the above
observations – late spring frosts affecting insect life perhaps, which may have
given the seed-eating finches an edge over the more insect-eating thrushes, piedwagtails, titmice and wrens that nest in our small garden and the adjacent fields.
If it is a widespread trend, no doubt some climate-change expert will put it down
to global warming, which is taking over from farming as the root of all evil in
the natural world.
I don’t believe it has anything to do with the fact that we are now fully organic. We have never used insecticides on the farm and the absence of artificial
fertiliser on the fields for the last three years seems to have been amply compensated for by the recent wet summers. Organic enthusiasts may say it is way
we are now farming, but apart from the partial composting of all the farmyard
manure we produce, Jim is continuing to farm very much as in the past. A run
of dry summers may expose deficiencies in the system, but meanwhile we are
growing as much grass as ever we have.
Most of the lambs, born in early March, have now been sold, grading better
than usual, but only getting an organic premium of ten per cent, which makes
their long journey to South Wales a doubtful advantage. The cattle are also
looking well, despite the rain; in fact I think they prefer it to blazing sunshine.
The organic beef premium at nearly thirty per cent above market price, which
we have been receiving for the past year, is much more of a bonus, and if it
stays at that level makes organic production a reasonable proposition.
If the weather will now let up and allow us to make our hay, which is
beginning to look distinctly tired, and continue fine through a good corn harvest,
2008 could yet turn out to be a vintage farming year - even if the butterflies do
not agree with me.

NFU Centenary History Is Essential Reading
A History of the NFU
In this, the centenary year of the National Farmers Union, it is perhaps
fitting that Guy Smith, an Essex farmer, journalist and NFU Council member,
has chosen to write a book entitled “From Campbell to Kendall - A History
of the NFU”. It is, by the author’s own admission, not exactly a history, but
rather a series of chapters recording separately the life and period in office of
the 33 men who have been its Presidents since 1909. He uses as his main source
of information the NFU Year Books, which in the early days were often several
hundred pages long.
As a believer in the need for a strong union and, for over half its lifetime, a
staunch NFU member, albeit a critical (some might say trouble-making) one, I
not unnaturally plunged into the book to pick out the chapters on those Presidents who I felt had made a pig’s ear of their time at the helm. This was a
mistake. There is too much overlap of events during the rise to power of individual Presidents to make for easy reading. The book should be read through
from the beginning and, though in places is somewhat disjointed, becomes what
I presume Guy Smith intends, a coherent history of the leadership of the NFU.
The end of the Second World War divides the story neatly into two time
spans. Most farmers of my generation will clearly remember, may have heard
speak at meetings or perhaps met in person, many of the 10 Presidents who
have held office since 1945. We have formed our own opinion of these men and
while the book may make us see them in a different light, they are not the
mysterious figures from earlier days, the 23 Presidents who founded and then
led the NFU through the depression years between the wars.
It is the chapters on these early Presidents that I found most interesting,
particularly on three of them who probably had the greatest influence on the
future of the NFU. The first, rather naturally, is Colin Campbell, who as Chairman of Lincolnshire Farmers Union in 1904, travelled the country persuading
other counties to amalgamate into a national organisation. He did this so successfully that four years later the NFU was founded with Campbell elected in
1909 as its first President. He continued as President until 1918, reluctant to
step down until he was sure the NFU was secure, not wishing anyone else to
endure the misery of having the fledging union die under their presidency. He
continued working for the NFU, sitting on a number of committees until his
death in 1933.
After Campbell, Presidents were only expected to hold office for one year.
498

Jul 23rd

NFU Centenary History Is Essential Reading

The impression one gets is that they were really acting as executive Chairmen,
the NFU being ruled largely by ex-Presidents chairing the various national committees. During those early years their names crop up repeatedly in subsequent
chapters as actively participating in Union affairs. One such, Thomas Baxter,
did more for farming in my opinion than any other President before or since,
not during 1927, his year in office, but in the 22 years that followed. The NFU’s
greatest achievement was the setting up of the Milk Marketing Board in 1933.
Baxter, as the milk committee chairman at the time, was less than enthusiastic about the idea, but an AGM vote in favour by the membership persuaded
him to change his mind. He subsequently became the MMB’s first chairman, a
job he held until he retired in 1949, being knighted for services to agriculture.
He died in 1951, the year I started farming with a small herd of dairy cows.
Without Baxter’s original election to the presidency, I wonder if I would be here
today.
My third most influential President has to be Reginald Dorman-Smith, at 37
one of the youngest ever, who within a year of standing down, became Minister
of Agriculture in 1939 at the beginning of the war. This did more to establish the
lines of communication with Whitehall than anything that had gone before, and
undoubtedly put the NFU in a better position to influence the Government’s
agriculture policy after the war ended.
Coming on to the post-war years, we are immediately faced with the imposing figure of Jim Turner, soon to become Sir James, and eventually before
retiring, Lord Netherthorpe, the longest serving President of them all, from
1945 to1960. I confess I always assumed he fully deserved the plaudits of his
fellow farmers, if not the fulsome praise he regularly received from the prime
ministers of his day. Guy Smith, perhaps unintentionally, throws some doubt
in my mind about the true value of his years in office, whether he was the great
man we, his humble farming members out in the sticks all thought he was or
whether he was just lucky to be in the right place at the right moment.
Early on, Turner seems to have radically changed the constitution of the
NFU to allow a power-hungry president to remain in office almost indefinitely.
He succeeded in securing an annual salary in line with his new professional
status, together with a presidential Bentley, complete with NFU 1 number plate
to chauffer him about. He even suggested the union should provide him with
a “small tied cottage” in Hertfordshire in the shape of a substantial property
designed by Christopher Wren, where he could entertain the great and the good.
This seems to have been a step too far, and he had to fund the purchase himself,
but he was afforded a flat in Park Lane.
499

2008
It was also around this time that the monstrous rabbit warren of a pretentious new NFU headquarters, built to house the rapidly expanding staff,
emerged from a Knightsbridge bombsite. I remember, during my year as a
branch chairman, being sent by my members to find out what went on behind
the hundred or more splendid windows that looked out across Hyde Park. But
I have to admit that it turned out later to have been one of the shrewdest purchases the NFU ever made. Nor can I deny that those years under Turner did
lay the foundations for a settled period of agricultural expansion, although the
seeds for dissatisfaction among many financially stressed farmers that were to
erupt later in bouts of militancy were certainly sown then.
Passing over that other giant of the agricultural world, Henry Plumb, for
whom I have always had a sneaking regard, there was one recent President
that I find on reading about his time in office, I completely misjudged. I am
referring to Simon Gourlay, who seemed aloof and patronizing at the meetings
I attended with the farmers he was supposed to be representing in his dealings
with the Thatcher government. He turns out to have been far more radical than
he appeared and did more than most to reverse the grandiose image of an NFU
president that he had inherited.
Guy Smith’s ‘History of the NFU’, while well illustrated, is not a coffee table
book, nor is it bedtime reading. But whether you are an NFU member or not,
it is certainly a book that every farmer should read once and keep somewhere
among his agricultural reference books. Covering as it does almost every piece
of legislation that affected farming through the 20th century, I know I shall be
referring to my copy frequently in the future.

Haymaking Is a Whole Lot Easier
We all have good days and bad days, but in farming it is more likely to be whole
weeks that stick in the mind. For me, last week was definitely one of the best
of the summer so far.
For a start, the barn owls have fledged, three healthy looking youngsters
now learning to fly in the hay barn. And the swallows that nest in our back
porch have just hatched their second brood, the parents busy feeding them as
we watch on our TV screen using a mini-camera. Of all the birds we have on
the farm, the breeding success of these two species always gives me hope that,
however hard the coming winter for the owls or dangerous their migration for
the swallows, they will be raising young here again next year.

Haymaking Is a Whole Lot Easier

The forecast was so promising that it looked like being the haymaking week
Jim had been waiting for. He mowed the four main hayfields at the weekend
and, with the sudden heat wave, had them all fit to bale by the Wednesday. If
you get the right weather, the speed of haymaking nowadays never ceases to
amaze me. It often used to take weeks rather than days to complete, and was
possibly the hardest spell of manual labour in the whole farming year.
I reckon I have experienced it all. I remember, as a schoolboy earning some
holiday money, standing on a 4-wheel Sussex haywain drawn by two Shires,
desperately passing loose hay to the chap making the load, as three or four men
on the ground pitched the hay up faster than I could handle it. If we managed
to get six three-ton loads back to the rick-yard and stacked in a day we were
doing well. The carbon footprint of haymaking in those days must have been
negligible.
It got easier, with hay sweeps, horse drawn or attached to the front of an old
car, hay-poles and elevators, tripods that could be brought in with a buckrake,
and eventually the advent of affordable pick-up balers. Our old baler is still
sitting at the back of the implement shed. How many small bales it produced
in its time I can only guess at – it must run into tens of thousands. The
thought of manhandling them onto trailers and unloading them into the barns
is something I would rather forget. The great advantage with small bales was
the ease of feeding them to the livestock.
But today it is all big bales, round ones or square ones. The contractor Jim
employs, uses a Hesston (large rectangular) baler, generally arriving in a hurry
to move on to the next farm. On this occasion he got into the first field at two
o’clock and was out of the last one by half-past five, having baled nearly 80
tonnes of hay. And apart from the fact that the grass in the largest field was
somewhat past its best, the quality of the hay was as good as any made here in
years past. One more day and Jim, with some part time help, had the whole
lot safely stacked away in the barns. I never had to do a hands-turn.
There are two more fields to cut, but if the weather is unhelpful, I doubt
Jim will bother. With enough hay to get us through the winter and a second
cut of red clover silage yet to make, the cattle can graze those last two late into
the autumn. Another fortnight and the corn will be ready for the combine.
On the Friday, Jenny and I went to Chulmleigh Old Fair, a Lammas fair with
five days of events that has been held in the town for the last 750 years. We had
a memorable evening’s entertainment listening to Tony Beard, talking seriously
for a change about his native Dartmoor as Anthony (to his close friends) Beard,
this year’s President of the Devonshire Association, followed by an hour in his
usual role as the Wag of Widecombe.
501

2008
And Saturday was Mid Devon Show day, as beautiful a summer’s day as
you could wish for, making up for last year’s cancellation through horrendous
weather. It must have had a record attendance, judging by the time we spent
in the queue for the overflow car park, but little things like that can’t spoil its
reputation as one of the best one-day shows in the west.

DEFRA Red Tape Ruins Farming
Why does officialdom take so much pleasure in blighting our lives? At present,
you can’t open an agricultural newspaper without being hit by one article after
another informing us about the government’s final decisions on the various
changes to farm regulations. We all know that DEFRA is pretty vague about
what actually goes on down on the farm, but even DEFRA must be aware that
this is harvest time, the busiest time of the year. It looks to me very like another
case of putting out bad news at an opportune moment that will produce the
least reaction from those worst affected – thus minimising the likelihood of the
public being alerted to what is happening.
A sharp increase in the red tape that has been strangling us for years has
been on the cards for some time. With all the recent talk by the Prime Minister
and Chancellor about their concern for the rising price of food and the decline in
world supply, there was hope that the final outcome would be moderated to let
us to get on with the job of producing food without too much extra regulation.
It looks as if our hopes have been dashed. It leaves farmers wondering whether
Gordon Brown knows that while he is preaching one agenda, his DEFRA ministers are following quite another. And what is worse, whether supermarket
shoppers have any idea that what is being decided will make food prices dearer
and reduce even further our ability to feed ourselves.
There are currently about six proposed regulations that need to be challenged with the support of the general public, but getting this through to the
man in the street is not going to be easy. The most serious would result in a
dramatic reduction in the agrochemicals available to European farmers. This
will be based on banning anything containing a so-called hazardous substance
in however minute an amount, although the product has been rigorously tested
for any danger to health. We conveniently forget that many of the plants we eat
without a second thought, have evolved containing hazardous substances, natural toxins and carcinogens, which help maintain the health of the plant. Nor
are we too bothered with the hazardous substances in the chemical products
we use daily with complete abandon all round the house.
502

Aug 13th

Quandary Over Older Sucklers

Apparently no research has been done to gauge the exact effect this legislation will have on agricultural output in Europe. It will obviously reduce it
considerably, but if we end up importing food that is produced in a way that
is outlawed here, we shall be no further forward. How many more times do we
need to go down this road, before those in charge realise the futility of it.
The next costly decision that farmers have been saddled with is the implementation of the new measures to prevent nitrates getting into streams and
rivers. It doesn’t seem to matter that in Britain we have actually reduced nitrogen pollution in recent years, that the cost of all fertiliser is rising so fast no
farmer in his right mind will allow it to be lost in this way, that conditions here
are very different to much of mainland Europe. And that making us spend vast
sums on extra storage so that we can all start spreading slurry on the same day
in our increasingly wet and flood prone summers, is a malodorous nonsense.
That takes me to another expensive proposal, the Electronic identification
of sheep, that has been foisted on us at short notice. Microchips will probably
replace ear tags in all farm animals eventually, but there is no certainty it is
workable at present. Since we have more sheep in the UK and NI than all the
other countries of Europe put together, it is we should be deciding when the
system is ready to be introduced. However DEFRA, as usual when pressured by
the green lobby, seems to have no problem planning to impose some form of setaside on us unilaterally, while Brussels is quite rightly scrapping the principle
everywhere else, of letting land lie idle with grain in short supply.
Finally, words fail me for now at the report that some little twerp of a junior
DEFRA minister has trotted over to Brussels and signed away our right to use
the acre as a unit of land measurement. The most evocative four-letter word in
the English language, I will return to that another time.

August 13th
Quandary Over Older Sucklers
This dismal summer weather is stuttering on into the autumn - a few hot fine
days alternating with spells of much too much rain. Where are the hotter drier
summers that the Met Office has been telling us to expect with climate change?
In case they are interested, we have a shallow spring (not a field drain) that
runs out into our lane. I have always taken note of this as a good seasonal
indicator of the ground water table. In average summers it usually dries up by
the middle of June, but in wetter years, it very occasionally persists into late
July. This year, for the first time to my knowledge since the early 1950s, it is
still flowing and looks like breaking a record by not going dry at all.
503

2008
As a result, there has been precious little harvesting done around here.
Cereal crops seem to be standing well and still have a good bright colour, but
that will soon change if we don’t get some dry weather in the next few weeks.
At least these days, once the combines get into action, harvesting doesn’t take
long. Years ago, waiting to cut corn with a binder in weather like this was
a nightmare prospect of repeatedly turning sheaves and remaking shocks, but
apart from wheat grown for thatching, that is no longer a worry. However
now that we are organic, the possibility of using a spray to desiccate any green
vegetation growing up into the corn so that a combine can operate properly,
something we had to do on at least one occasion in the past, is no longer an
option.
Starting an organic arable rotation, our two fields of triticale were sown last
autumn into ploughed up permanent pasture, which can be difficult to bury
completely in the first year. There are signs that some of the grass is making
a comeback with all this moisture to help it, and it will be a relief to see a
combine in action as soon as possible. But life is never that simple. Only the
other day, the chap whom Jim had lined up to do the combining asked if our
council lane was wide enough for his ten-foot wheelbase machine to get to the
fields. On checking, Jim found there were sections that were barely nine-foot
wide from bank to bank. The last time we grew corn in these fields, combines
must have been smaller. Finding a contractor with an older machine may not
be easy - just one of the joys of present-day farming in an out-of-date Devon
countryside.
On quite a different subject, decision time has arrived regarding the immediate slaughter of nearly a third of our suckler herd through the Older Cattle
Disposal Scheme. I have been trying for months to find out what the cost to us
would be of keeping these trusty old cows, ranging in age from 12 to 16 years, to
live out their productive lives, eventually to be put down on farm and removed
for incineration through the National Fallen Stock Company. A final phone
call this week still produced no clarification, although it was confirmed that, if
we did not take advantage of the scheme, we would be financially responsible
from Jan 1st next year. I am more than ever convinced that this uncertainty
is DEFRA’s way of bullying us into getting rid of as many of these perfectly
healthy animals as possible now, so that a line can be drawn under its years-long
responsibility for keeping older cattle out of the food chain.
With little option, therefore, and time running out in which to register these
cows, Jim has booked them into the scheme for slaughter in December. This
does have immediate implications for the management of the herd. We shall
have to retain for breeding most of this years crop of finished heifers, which will
504

Aug 20th

Headage Basis for Cost Share

make a considerable dent in the year’s income from beef sales. We shall also
have to buy another bull, at considerable expense, since to avoid inbreeding, we
cannot use our current bull on his own heifers. It also looks as if he will be for
the chop long before his normal time, since two bulls in a herd the size of ours
are an extravagance and possible nuisance. It will be some years before we can
resume our normal practice of retaining from time to time three or four heifers
out of our best older cows as herd replacements.

August 20th
Headage Basis for Cost Share
The Government, in its wisdom, has decided that in future farmers should
share the cost of controlling animal diseases. This is apparent in a proposal,
currently being floated by DEFRA, to make us pay an annual headage charge
on all our farm animals. It is likely to be one of the suggestions in a DEFRA
consultation on cost sharing being set up for this autumn. What on earth does
the government think we have been doing all these years?
Much of the cost of dealing with notifiable diseases has always been borne by
farmers. Apart from the loss of sick animals, we have been expected to accept
the culling of healthy animals at pretty basic compensation rates. There has
never been any government consideration given for loss of business, closure of
markets, restriction on animal movements and all the other legal constraints
we are saddled with for weeks following a disease outbreak. If that isn’t cost
sharing, I don’t know what is.
Included in the new proposals is the intention to set up an independent
animal health body, part funded by this tax on livestock, in recognition of
which farmers would be allowed a say in decision-making. The government is
obviously trying to duck the responsibility for the escalating expense to the
taxpayer of animal health over the last ten years and is preparing to pass the
buck. However, I can see no good reason at present why farmers should be
expected to bear a bigger share of this expense, and I trust that during the
coming consultation period, our farming representatives will make this clear to
the public.
Consider the various animal diseases we have had to deal with during the
last decade. Currently farmers are involved in a blanket vaccination programme
to prevent a countrywide outbreak of bluetongue in our cattle and sheep. While
DEFRA was instrumental in underwriting the supply of vaccine, we are meeting
the full cost of vaccination and, with no compensation for animals that succumb
to the disease, there will be little, if any, expense to the taxpayer.
505

2008
The recent serious outbreak of bird-flu that involved the compulsory slaughter of thousands of turkeys at a Bernard Matthews farm in Norfolk, did result
in the payment of a large sum in government compensation. It subsequently
turned that the outbreak could have been avoided had there been better supervision by DEFRA of the conditions that allowed for the transport of turkey-meat
from the firm’s plant in Eastern Europe.
There was also the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Surrey, caused by
a leaking drain in the animal health facility at Pirbright, the maintenance of
which was DEFRA’s responsibility. The local farms that were involved are only
now getting back to normal, and while the compensation bill may have been
tiny by comparison with the 2001 outbreak, the considerable cost to the farming
industry in market disruption due to animal movement restrictions right across
the country has never been met.
Reflecting on the horror story that was 2001 and 2002, and leaving aside the
mental anguish inflicted on the farmers involved, can anyone seriously suggest
that the government’s handling of the disease in any way minimised the eventual
cost to the exchequer. Further than that, it is now apparent that the outbreak
was caused by the failure to close down a swill-processing farm following a
ministry inspection.
And the story doesn’t end there. Through all these years, we have been
allowing bovine TB to march relentlessly on, gaining a firmer grip on our cattle
herds and producing a bottomless well down which to chuck taxpayers money. I
have no doubt that history will prove it was the failure to deal with the wildlife
reservoir of TB that has cost the industry dear.
Is it hardly surprising, therefore, that the Government is now trying to
distance itself from the decision making process, knowing that it will take at
least two years before any new animal health body is up and running. By that
time, New Labour may no longer be in power. Not that I have any great faith
in the ability of a Tory government to do any better. It was Maggie Thatcher,
who was originally responsible for cutting down our animal health division to a
shadow of its former self, possibly the real reason we are in such a mess today.

NFU Can Now Make Amends

August 27th
NFU Can Now Make Amends
Was that a clarion call I heard last week echoing through the milk producing
counties of the UK? Or was it no more than a cry of despair from dairy farmers
on learning of Tesco’s plans to sell milk at less than the cost of production?
I am referring to the warning from Gwyn Jones, NFU dairy board chairman,
that farmers must be ready to challenge the retailers if the stability of the milk
industry is threatened.
I am no longer a dairy farmer, but milk production underpins livestock
farming to such an extent that all of us should have grave concerns about
this latest development. We have only recently completed a campaign, with
enormous help from many outside bodies led by the Women’s Institute, to
shame the supermarkets into paying dairy farmers a realistic price and charging
a sympathetic public the going rate for milk.
For Tesco to claim that its latest venture in starting a price-cutting war
will in no way imperil producers’ milk contracts is deceitful in the extreme. In
all the supermarkets, fresh whole milk is sold in large quantities as a standard
product. To market milk cheaply under the name Fresh ‘n’ Lo is merely a
fraudulent way of exploiting a money-off promotion that will, in very short
order, have all standard milk being sold at a lower price, but under a fancy
label. When milk contract negotiations eventually become due, Tesco will no
doubt claim it is a straightforward case of consumer-choice dictating the level
of price.
Unless the supermarket ‘watch dog’ steps in and bans this obvious case of
underhand dealing, we shall be back to a situation where only the big producers
will be able to survive and the exodus from dairy farming will accelerate once
more. We can hardly expect the gallant W.I. to initiate another campaign. This
all reinforces my concern that the direct farmer contracts that were entered into
in recent years by the retailers, ostensibly to safeguard their supplies and be
seen to be giving some farmers a better milk price, were really a ploy enabling
them to divide and control the industry.
While it is understandable that the NFU is at this time telling farmers to
stand up to the retailers and demand fairer milk contracts, this is hardly the call
to arms that many of us are expecting. The situation is almost reminiscent of the
early 1930s, when dairy farmers were at such odds with the milk-buying firms
that the NFU undertook the formidable task of setting up the Milk Marketing
Board. Unfortunately, when the time came, 60 years later, to wind up what had
507

2008
been the most successful marketing cooperative British farmers have known, the
transition to a deregulated market seems to have been left to chance.
I know there were divisions within the MMB at the time about the possibility of breaking up its processing company, Dairy Crest, but the government was
apparently unwilling to allow a national voluntary milk cooperative to retain a
processing facility. How far this position was challenged by the NFU is unclear,
but the obvious alternative of setting up two or, at most, three regional cooperatives each with a proportion of the Dairy Crest facilities divided between
them, (something that many of us considered far more likely to succeed than
the ill-fated Milk Marque), seems to have been completely ignored.
I blame the NFU, which met the challenge so well in 1933, for failing to give
the industry the necessary leadership in 1993. Milk producers, so far as I can
recall, were never even canvassed for their opinion, but left virtually to their
own devices. It is surprising in the circumstances how far they have come in
forming substantial milk cooperatives, but the next step of amalgamating these
into businesses large enough to take on the supermarkets needs outside help.
That is obvious from the failure this year of the attempted merger between the
two farmer owned co-ops, Milk Link and First Milk.
Now, therefore, is surely the moment for the NFU to announce that it will
immediately put its full weight behind whatever is required to bring co-ops like
these together. The last thing it needs is the oft-repeated jibe that the NFU is
just a big farmers club. The dairy board chairman, Gwyn Jones, has an ideal
opportunity to correct what should have been attempted 15 years ago.

Poor Forecast Was Blessing in Disguise
I know one is not supposed to shoot the bearer of bad news, but there have been
times lately when a TV weather forecaster’s life would have been in extreme
jeopardy if he or she had turned up on the farm. Actually, it is when they get
the forecast wrong that causes the irritation and that seems to be happening
too often since the Met Office moved to Exeter, not twenty miles from here.
However, there are rare occasions when making a pig’s ear of it can be a
blessing in disguise. Last week was a case in point. Our red clover leys have
been in urgent need of cutting for silage for some time. They were in full
flower, which in a normal year should have been attracting a host of cloudedyellow butterflies. Left for much longer and the clover would be going to seed,
damaging the leys for the future. The Country File forecast for the week looked
508

Sep 3rd

Poor Forecast Was Blessing in Disguise

hopeful – becoming drier after Tuesday, sunny by Friday and a further general
improvement over the weekend.
With the possibility that the corn harvest might soon be in full swing, the
contractor was booked to bale the clover on the Friday, before a rush on his
services made him difficult to pin down. Tuesday dawned overcast and damp,
but with that promise of better weather to come, Jim went ahead and mowed.
There was no improvement - Wednesday and Thursday remaining cloudy with
occasional drizzle and by then the forecast had changed. Saturday would be
the fine day, with thunderstorms due on the Sunday and a wet week to follow.
I doubt whether Jim would have attempted to make silage, had he known
what was coming. In the event, with the ground very soft and only one careful
windrowing of the crop possible, a dull but dry Friday saw the clover baled,
hauled back to the farm, wrapped and stacked. It actually turned out much
better than expected, although by the time the machinery had finished, the
fields were looking decidedly battle weary. A sunny Saturday to dry the surface,
followed by even more wet weather, and the clover is recovering fast, with the
tyre marks already greening up. And we have since heard that the contractor
had a breakdown on the Saturday morning, so had Jim delayed baling, the clover
might even now be gently rotting in the swath. But without that inaccurate
forecast, the silage would probably never have been cut at all.
That leaves us with just the triticale to harvest to see off this dreadful
summer. The grain is now quite ripe, but the straw, which we value almost as
much, will soon be deteriorating if the weather doesn’t improve. Meanwhile,
the first of the autumn calves has been born. For all the lack of sunlight on their
backs, the cattle are looking well with ample grass available for a few months
yet - that is if the ground doesn’t poach too much.
Once again, there is a nasty cough going through the yearlings. We are sure
it is a touch of husk, but without proof, our organic status prohibits immediate
treatment. It occurred last year and, with the lab samples Jim took at the
time coming back negative, we let the cough run its course. Unless an animal
becomes desperately ill, we shall presumably do the same this year, but it is not
my idea of good stock husbandry. Taking no account of a lifetimes experience
with cattle is one of the examples of the blinkered attitude shown by the Soil
Association, which I find very irritating.
Perhaps their new president, the former Gardeners World presenter, Monty
Don, may loosen things up a bit. The comment he made in his first newspaper
interview that “Organic is loaded with a sense of rightness, with a set of rules”,
gives me hope for the future. He is even suggesting the title “organic” should
be replaced by “sustainable”, to get rid of the public perception that farming
509

2008
in this way is catering for the wealthy few. That will have the Soil Association
directors choking on their organic cornflakes, but with the Guardian newspaper
reporting a twenty per cent drop in organic sales since February, he may well
have a point.
However, although Monty is obviously an expert gardener, it would be interesting to find out how much he knows about looking after livestock. I trust
he is not another vegetarian.

Carbon Horse Feathers
.doc
We are hearing more and more about the need for farmers to measure our
carbon footprint, reduce our greenhouse gases, and generate our own energy
from anaerobic digesters. So much so that, any day now, I am expecting a thick
must-read booklet from DEFRA to drop onto the doormat. But if I follow every
instruction to the letter, will it make a blind bit of difference to the future of
the planet? Of course not – frankly, it is all a load of horse feathers.
Surely nobody seriously believes that by insisting UK farmers tinker about
with footling ideas like these while China is investing in new coal-fired power
stations, South America is burning brushwood from rain forest clearances and
some idiots are setting fire to the Californian woodland, we are going to make
the slightest impression on total CO2 emissions. I know all about the official
line that whatever the consequences, it is our duty to set an example to the rest
of the world. Farmers are only too well aware that the rest of the world merely
laughs - raising animal welfare standards without controlling imports exposed
the folly of that philosophy.
All that is likely to happen will be an even greater decline in the amount of
homegrown food we produce, for two obvious reasons. Either we shall spend so
much time shovelling pig and cow slurry into anaerobic digesters, between visits
to our bank managers to explain away the overdrafts we have racked up in their
construction, that the efficient management of our farms will suffer. Or, more
probably, we shall take the simple option and reduce our livestock numbers to
just below the level at which DEFRA will charge us for exceeding our emissions
quotas, if such things are measurable. At least, we can then ease back and enjoy
the cool damp summers we seem to be getting.
The only way to make a real difference to the damage we are doing to the
planet is to reduce the amount of fossil fuel we burn. That seems so obvious that
even Gordon Brown talked recently about the need for Britain to become less
510

dependant on imported mineral oil. Unfortunately, when it comes to farming, he
is doing very little to make it happen. Agriculture is the one industry that could
easily manage to grow all the motive power we need by producing biodiesel from
oilseed rape. It is true that, leaving aside any tax implications, at the current
value of rapeseed of around £300 a tonne, biodiesel is not a cheaper option.
And any comparison has to take into account the fossil energy used to produce
the fertiliser involved in growing the crop.
But at present and for the foreseeable future, diesel from whatever source is
the only tractor fuel available to us. So why is there so little enthusiasm being
shown by government to encourage farmers to develop a guaranteed supply,
safe from the instability of world markets? Where is the support for small scale
on-farm oilseed crushers, which is so freely available for wind turbines scattered
across the landscape, none of which will power a tractor? The technology for
producing biodiesel at farm level is already well developed and used on the
continent, especially in Germany. What research is being done to promote the
cultivation of rape and other oil producing crops with minimal or no fertiliser
requirements? And where are the organic organisations in all this? They seem
strangely silent, considering that organic farming uses as much diesel as other
forms of food production.
I would have thought most farmers would welcome the prospect of being
independent of the multinational oil companies. On a 300-acre livestock farm
of our size, ten acres would be sufficient to grow the biodiesel required to replace
all the red diesel we purchase in an average year. In our case, as an organic
farm, without the use inorganic fertiliser we would have to raise this to fifteen
acres, but that is still only half the land that would have been needed 70 years
ago to feed the horses. I seem somehow to have got back to horses – perhaps
people with more knowledge than I have on the subject of alternative fuel, will
be invoking the term “horse feathers” to these suggestions.

September 24th
Banking on Change Ahead
There is no need to worry about a shortage of home grown food – the City of
London’s highly successful financial services industry will allow us to import
whatever we need from anywhere in the world. So said the Chancellor earlier
this year, when farmers voiced concern that declining production was putting
Britain’s food security at risk.
Now, only a few short months later, we have banner headlines proclaiming
that greedy City traders will be clamped down on to prevent the excessive risk
511

2008
taking that has led to their six and seven figure annual bonuses. And it is
not just a few high-flyers earning this kind of money. There are thousands of
these financial spivs apparently, who, it is estimated, invested over £5 billion
in property last year alone, driving up the housing market and helping to bring
the banking world to the brink of collapse. These are the people, according to
Alistair Darling, who are underwriting the nations future food supplies. Some
hopes! I doubt if many of them would know how to grow mustard-and-cress on
wet blotting paper if world food supplies became seriously threatened.
Meanwhile, vast amounts of money are being made available to shore up
capitalism for the time being. It is strange how the rich nations spend days
at G8 meetings agreeing a few millions to alleviate third world famine, money
which sometimes never reaches the people in need, but have no difficulty finding
billions, even trillions of pounds baling out first world banks.
And whose money is it that is being thrown around with such abandon? In
America, it is apparently the taxpayer who will foot the bill. Here, the Prime
Minister is on record as saying that it is a loan to the financial institutions, which
will repay the money over time. In other words, those of us with overdrafts or
mortgages will have to shell out, although I am not sure what happens if too
many of us go broke in the process. Nor do I understand where the Treasury
is borrowing the money from to offer this lifeline to the Banks – the OPEC
countries or China perhaps? Or is the Bank of England merely being asked to
print money, at the risk of fuelling runaway inflation?
I have noticed that the ethics of the banking fraternity seems to have declined markedly over the years. As a lad, working on my uncle’s farm in school
holidays, I recall the annual visit by his bank managers just before Christmas,
presumably to see if the farm overdraft was properly secured. I say bank managers in the plural – there were two of them, one his current manager and the
other his previous, by then retired manager. With their wives in attendance,
they were obviously friends of the family. After a pre-Christmas lunch with all
the trimmings, the men folk would take a leisurely stroll of inspection round the
farm, carrying guns in case a foolhardy pheasant saw fit to test their alertness,
and the evening would be spent playing whist, giving my uncle a chance to win
back some of the overdraft interest he had shelled out during the year.
I never managed to get on quite those terms with our bank managers when I
started farming, although in the early days they were certainly on our side when
it came to getting our overdraft temporarily under its limit once a year. But
as time went on, they seemed to become less interested in the person they were
lending money to, and only concerned with the state of the annual accounts.
512

Lunacy of DEFRA’s Red Tape

The importance of a yearly visit to the farm also declined, sometimes showing surprising ignorance about what went on on the land. I remember one
manager, coming out during silage making, who confessed to having no idea
what we were actually doing. These days we no longer have a local manager,
being governed by some distant agricultural executive whose name I forget.
Contact through the telephone is virtually impossible, and then only via the
sub-continent.
But all may yet change. The Chancellor promised only the other day that
the credit crunch is under control and food prices will soon come down. Not, I
can assure him, if oil prices remain high and bank interest rates reach the dizzy
heights of the late ‘70s. Farmers also have expenses to meet and home food
production may well decline even further.

October 1st
Lunacy of DEFRA’s Red Tape
We have finally reached the end of the year – all is safely gathered in and all
that. Or nearly all - the last few acres of straw in the wettest part of one of
the fields has had to be abandoned. There was just too much grass mixed with
it and unless there is an unexpected heat wave in October, it will presumably
have to be ploughed in. In many ways it has been the strangest year I can
remember. Each harvesting operation – the first-cut silage, the haymaking, the
second-cut silage and finally the corn harvest – has had to be done when the
few windows of opportunity in the persistent wet weather presented themselves.
We were lucky with the corn harvest in the end. We began by having
a problem finding a combine harvester narrow enough to get down our lane.
Contractors’ machines are much wider now than they were when we last grew
corn in these fields. Jim eventually located a farmer in the parish, a friend
whose family I have known since I first came to Devon, with a combine that
could negotiate the route into our two fields. He very kindly agreed to cut our
corn when he had completed his harvest. He duly arrived a couple of weeks
ago while the sun was actually shining for a change, and slowly and carefully,
working during the warmer part of each day, he harvested our triticale as if it
were his own. Another spell of wet weather and I think the corn would have
disappeared into the accumulating vegetation.
The moisture content of the grain was inevitably very high, but Jim substantially, if expensively, increased the amount of propionic acid with which we
routinely treat our grain, and all seems well. The straw was quite another matter. There was so much grass there that we had to move it with a hay turner
513

2008
three or four times to get it anything like fit to bale. And, as I said earlier,
some four acres never were baled.
These particular four acres are heavy clay ground and were once a separate
field. It was tile-drained in the 1850s, and, according to the old tithe maps,
merged with the adjacent drier ground by removing the surrounding hedges.
Oh yes, our ancestors knocked out hedges in those days much as we did 100
years later. In a normal summer this causes no problem, but in a year like
this, even with good drainage, this piece of bottomland can become very soft.
We were concerned that the combine might get bogged down, but in the event,
possibly thanks to the mat of vegetation, the surface was hardly broken.
I have no doubt our harvesting difficulties were much the same as on farms
everywhere in the southwest; in fact we were probably luckier than most where
bigger acreages are involved. The real horror of getting machinery stuck in the
mud thankfully never materialised. I confess it never occurred to me at the
time that, by attempting to harvest our corn and risk getting bogged down, we
might be breaking the conditions of our Single Farm Payment scheme. That
is until DEFRA magnanimously announced that in view of the bad weather
we could forgo the stricture about working on waterlogged land. Oh, and we
mustn’t forget that we are obliged to reinstate the condition of the ground at a
later date and note down the events in our soil management records.
This is the kind of agricultural red tape that makes one wonder if the people
who dream up these regulations have ever actually put on a pair of Wellington
boots. Do they think we scummer around in the mud, damaging our machinery
for the fun of it? And surely the best way of reinstating the condition of the
ground is to do absolutely nothing until it has properly dried out and then carry
on farming as normal. Recording that in our farm records would be a joke.
Our DEFRA Secretary of State, Hilary Benn, at the recent Labour Party
Conference, admitted that we need to increase food production in the UK (has
he at last seen the light?) and told us to talk up the industry to encourage the
next generation of farmers to come forward. It might be helpful if Mr Benn
made a start by overhauling his own Ministry. Young would-be farmers are
hardly likely to be encouraged by the sight of this generation labouring under
senseless bureaucracy while doing our real job of combating the weather.

Why Are We Left With Hilary Benn?

October 8th
Why Are We Left With Hilary Benn?
I have a strange feeling that we have just lived through one of those weeks after
which nothing is ever quite the same again. I am not referring to the melt
down of the world’s stock markets and the collapse of confidence in the banking
institutions, but the demise of DEFRA. I presume it is the end of the DEFRA
we have loved to hate – surely even the Prime Minister can’t take away from a
Government Department its initial responsibility, in this case ‘the environment’,
without at least changing its title.
Not that anyone has so far explained how the new set up is going to work
for farmers. We are, after all, as much involved in the environment and energy
(especially the production of green fuel) as anyone else. We must, therefore,
to some extent come under the jurisdiction of Ed Miliband, brother of David,
our ex-farm Minister, who showed some promise during the year he was with
us. At the same time, we obviously remain subject to regulations governing
food production and rural affairs, and will therefore continue to be governed by
Hilary Benn. There are bound to be overlaps between the two new departments
and where there are, who will be overall boss - Ed, coming up in the world or
Hilary, obviously going down?
I am not particularly bothered about what the new departments are called,
although you can be sure some over-paid civil servant will make a very costly
job of changing all the ministerial stationery to expunge the ‘e’ for ‘environment’ from DEFRA and add it to whatever name the new business and climate
change department ends up with. What really does concern me is the continuing presence of Mr Benn in charge of agriculture. All he appeared to enjoy
about his job was his responsibility for climate change. Decisions relating to
farming seemed merely to give him a pain in the rump.
Since the cost and availability of food is bound to become ever more important as time goes on, the country would be far better served if the roles had been
reversed and Gordon Brown had put Miliband to sort out what is becoming an
increasingly dysfunctional agricultural ministry. The Prime Minister is surely
aware that Benn will have to go very soon – I presume our farming leaders have
been taking every opportunity recently to voice our total loss of confidence in
his ability to have charge of our industry.
We desperately need a minister, who will begin by making a real effort to understand what producing food is all about, and then, during what is inevitably
only a limited time in the job, lead from the front in both Whitehall and Brussels. We seem to have had a very poor selection of agricultural ministers over
515

2008
the last twenty years and I cannot think of a single one I would wish to see back
in office today.
The current concern about the shortage of money in the banks, which appears to be shaking capitalism to its foundations, would be as nothing to the
alarm that would arise if there were bread in the shops. It seems to have escaped
the public notice that the EU has just completed a massive cereal harvest, 20
per cent up on last year, with wheat production up by 25m tonnes. Fortunately,
the weather has not been as miserable for Continental farmers as it has been
for us.
What has also been overlooked is the resulting fall in the price of wheat –
down by as much as 30 to 50 per cent depending on quality. A bonus for hard
pressed livestock farmers in the short term, but a situation that poses a real
threat to the future. With energy costs remaining high and banks now reluctant
to stretch overdrafts, it would be very surprising if arable farmers did not cut
back substantially on planting for next year’s harvest.
Is our Mr Benn aware of the consequences of doing nothing about it now – it
will be far too late in six months time? He should be hotfooting it to Brussels to
discuss measures with his fellow ministers to ensure that the emerging confidence
in the future of farming is not snuffed out prematurely. Chucking money about
like confetti as Governments are doing now, will not produce a single extra loaf
if there is a shortage in twelve months time.

Disease Vaccine Nonsense
The roar of rutting stags has been echoing across the valley in recent weeks.
Our small herd of red deer has been engaged in the usual autumnal mating
rites. They are not actually our deer, but about a dozen wild deer that have
been resident on our neighbour’s and our farm for the past two years. I get a
splendid view from my office window of the stags clashing for supremacy about
three hundred yards away on the hillside opposite. Maybe that is too strong a
description as there is obviously one dominant male and the remaining stags,
younger and smaller, are really only engaged in some half-hearted jousting.
There have been a few red deer on the farm from time to time, but never
continuously for as long as this. Some years ago, we had as many as seventeen
stags, which stayed all summer, but disappeared before the rut, presumably
back to Exmoor. It will be interesting to see if the present group remain for a
third year. Five of them are hinds, with one or two dropping calves last spring.
516

Oct 22nd

Disease Vaccine Nonsense

If they do become a permanent addition to the farm’s already abundant fuana,
we may eventually have a problem with too many grazing animals.
We have always had a healthy number of roe deer – which varies little from
year to year. Add to that the usual complement on a mid-Devon grassland farm
of rabbits, which can, if uncontrolled, eat or spoil a fair few acres. Farming beef
cattle and sheep extensively, and attempting to be self-sufficient in feed and
bedding, we are currently fairly well balanced without having to interfere with
the wildlife. In fact, it is a pleasure to have them around. But a rapid increase
in red deer numbers might mean that some form of culling would be necessary.
Fencing them out is virtually impossible.
There is a consideration that immediately arises. I went to check our calving
cows one evening early in October, as they seemed unduly agitated. To my
surprise, I found a red deer hind in among them. What is more, it seemed
determined to remain with them, hiding behind cows as I attempted to drive it
away, something I have never experienced before. It eventually retreated into
nearby woodland, hopping over stock-proof fencing as if it wasn’t there. What
was there however was a huge number of midges, which is only to be expected
at this time of year. Naturally, the words ‘blue tongue disease’ immediately
flashed through my mind.
All our cattle and sheep were vaccinated against blue tongue some months
ago. Any farmer who has failed to do likewise is, in my opinion, a complete idiot
and is putting all livestock farmers at risk. But the deer on our farm obviously
have no immunity, and there is nothing we can do about it. The theory is that
provided 80% of susceptible animals are vaccinated, the disease, if it does arise
this autumn, will be contained. So far as I am aware, there have been no new
cases this year in the UK, apart from those detected in imported animals, but
the next few weeks will be critical.
I am left with two slight worries. We have a number of autumn-born calves
that are over a month old. Although we are advised not to vaccinate animals
before they reach that age, they presumably could now become infected with
blue tongue. Even if we were able to obtain the very small amounts of vaccine
needed to immunise them, they would need a second jab in three weeks and
would still not be protected for some while after that - by which time the danger
period should be over.
Secondly, we are only protected against the BTv8 strain of the disease, the
one affecting northern Europe. A second strain, BTv1, is currently spreading
rapidly up through western France. It has already reached the Bordeaux area,
with nearly 3000 cases reported. French farmers there are now vaccinating
against both BTv8 and 1. It is highly likely that the new strain will reach the
517

2008
English Channel by the end of the year. You would assume, therefore, that UK
farmers would be using both vaccines for the top-up jab before turn out next
spring. But no – under some arcane Brussels regulation, we can only vaccinate
against BTv1 after a case has occurred in the UK. A jab in a tender part of
their anatomy would not come amiss for the officials who dreamed up that idea.

October 29th
The Woes of Slow E-mails
I received an email from a friend the other day with an attachment he thought
might interest me. However, on attempting to download it, the little genie in my
computer that controls these matters pointed out that the attachment would
take 75 minutes to come through - did I wish to proceed? Anyone without
broadband will know exactly what I am talking about. My friend expected it
to download almost instantly and apologised for forgetting that we lived out in
the sticks.
Unfortunately, this is happening more and more often. The various farming
organisations that contact us through our email address assume we can transfer swiftly to a given website to expand the information they are sending us.
Even DEFRA are now getting in on the act. A recent letter about some latest
regulation gave us a website where we could download the full text. Guessing
from past experience how large this was likely to be, I didn’t even attempt it.
With so much time spent waiting for my computer to reveal the incoming
pearls of Internet wisdom, I have taken to keeping my current bedside book on
my desk. Even that can be a mistake, since in reading instead of watching the
screen, a seemingly indigestible gobbet of information can interrupt the flow,
which jams up the computer altogether. There is also the inconvenience of
having the only phone line to the house engaged for long periods during the
day.
Frankly, the situation is becoming intolerable and we are not prepared to
put up with it much longer. I don’t see why we should accept being stuck in
the horse-and-cart age in modern communications. I mentioned earlier that my
emailing correspondent assumed we were out of range of our local telephone
exchange, but this is not actually the problem. Originally our connection, like
all phone lines at that time, reached us as two bare copper wires on telephone
poles along our lane hedge. In those pre-hedge-trimmer days, our phone line
was frequently at odds with branches blowing in the wind, and GPO linesmen
were regularly called on to restore our contact with the outside world. When
mains water finally reached us in 1965, we suggested that it might save a lot of
518

Oct 29th

The Woes of Slow E-mails

trouble if our phone line was put underground with our water pipe. The post
office readily agreed and provided us with a reel of insulated four-strand wire,
two strands for immediate use and two in case another phone was needed in the
future.
This has given us forty years of almost uninterrupted phone use. The GPO
and, more recently, British Telecom, have also gained from the complete absence
of any maintenance requirement for about 700 yards of phone line. I say ‘almost
uninterrupted’ because that rather primitive four-strand wire has now, after all
these years, somehow been adapted to provide a connection for four separate
telephone users.
A number of broadband providers have at one time or another approached
us, and I have agreed on each occasion to make use of their services if they can
deliver. They all check and come back to report that everything is fine with
both our line and exchange connection and we will shortly be enjoying instant
unlimited surfing. A week or two later, we are informed that there seems to
be an unexpected problem and we hear no more. One company did manage to
go one better and persuade BT to send out a maintenance engineer to survey
our line. He very quickly confirmed that, because this section of underground
line is now providing BT with four separate sources of income, something for
which it was never intended, it would have to be replaced before there is any
possibility of our receiving broadband.
Unfortunately, BT is apparently under no obligation to upgrade the line.
Why should it – it is doing very nicely out of it with no maintenance to worry
about? I say apparently because I am finding it quite impossible to get through
to anyone at BT with the authority to discuss the problem. It is hardly surprising therefore that I have a very low opinion of the company just now.
We may be an unusual case, but there are probably many other isolated
farms and rural dwellings that are being treated in a similar cavalier fashion by
BT. It would be helpful to hear of any, because I certainly do not intend to give
up on it.

Measuring Carbon Footprints
A curious placard caught my eye as we walked into Crediton Farmer’s Market
last Saturday. It was in front of the stall belonging to our neighbours, Dodie
and Roger Huxter, who sell beef and lamb produced on their farm. The sign
read ‘Red Ruby Devon Beef’ and their farm name, but it had a bold red line
running through all the words. On the face of it, it didn’t make much sense.
They could hardly have run out of beef so quickly – we had arrived unusually
early. Nor were the Huxters likely to have suddenly switched breeds – they were
present at this year’s Devon Breed Society’s Annual Dinner. Were they perhaps
thinking of giving up selling at what is probably the best Farmer’s Market in the
South West? Surely not, since they were among the original dedicated group
of farmers, who had done so much to get the market established.
The answer, which I got from Dodie over the heads of the people thronging
their stall, seems quite ridiculous, but I suppose only to be expected in these
highly regulated times. An official from Trading Standards had been round and
told them that the wording on their placard was in breach of the law. I take my
hat off to the Huxters for not removing the offending sign, but merely putting
a red line through it. I have no idea whether that makes it legal or not, but I
gather it generated quite a lot of interest from their customers.
Apparently, new regulations governing farmers markets have recently emerged
from DEFRA, possibly a gold plating of some vague proposals originating in
Brussels, which will require stallholders to undergo an annual inspection. The
cost is likely to run into four figures and is intended to ensure that the labelling
of their produce is accurate, something which when you think about it, is well
nigh impossible. It may weed out dodgy traders, who are not really farmers
or small businesses, but these should be obvious to the committee members
running the markets. The stallholders are generally local people well known
to most of us, whose main concern is surely to retain the confidence of their
regular customers, something that no amount of clipboard-style inspection can
replace.
My criticism that we appear to be taking an expensive sledgehammer to
crack a fairly insignificant nut may seem strange to urban shoppers, particularly as farmers are always complaining about the lack of proper food labelling.
However, in this instance, it is not the contents of the pack or carton that we
want accurately shown, but rather to have the country of origin clearly stated.
For too long we have had to compete with imported food that that has been
produced in conditions that would be illegal here.

Future of Organics in Doubt?

There was some excitement in farming circles, therefore, about Environment
Secretary Hilary Benn’s announcement that everything we buy or sell will soon
have to show the carbon footprint generated in its production. At first sight,
it looks as if this may be another way of encouraging people to buy British, or
better still, local.
The NFU has welcomed the news as a step in the right direction, with
the obvious reservations about the problems of measuring accurately the other
greenhouse gases that only agriculture generates in any significant amounts. I
confess my heart sank into my boots on reading about DEFRA’s latest initiative.
Grand ideas from DEFRA have a nasty habit of turning into very expensive and
impractical schemes. It claims that the Publicly Available Specification (PAS)
system, as it is to be called, will detail the entire life cycle of all products.
What we are all waiting to hear now are the details implicit in operating such
a scheme at farm level. Will it be compulsory to supply an individual PAS figure
with everything that leaves the farm? Or will, for example, a bullock being sold
through the local livestock market carry a standard rating depending on breed
and method of rearing? I am not being frivolous – a standard rating would
render the whole scheme meaningless, since there would be no incentive for a
farmer to reduce the carbon hoof prints of his cattle. And an individual PAS
figure so complex to calculate, every bunch of bullocks on every farm being
different to some degree, that the scheme would collapse under the weight of its
own paperwork.

November 12th
Future of Organics in Doubt?
There is a distinct possibility that organic food, as a separate entity, may soon
disappear from supermarket shelves. And the Soil Association appears to be
helping to bring this about.
My reasons for believing this stems from the very steep drop in the price we
shall get for some two-year-old grass-finished organic Angus steers that went
for slaughter this week. They are similar to a bunch of fat bullocks we sold in
June to the same abattoir, our regular outlet, which supplies Tesco. But the
price since then has declined by over 20 per cent and we shall end up getting
little more for our animals than we would have received had we marketed them
as bog-standard beef.
What is surprising, and therefore worrying for organic producers, is the fact
that the price being paid for this bog-standard beef, as I rather rudely call it,
has hardly dropped in the last five months. This indicates to me that total
521

2008
beef sales have not altered. It is the organic sales, and with them the organic
premiums, that have faded away.
We have all been overwhelmed during the last few months by the worldwide credit crunch, heightened now by dire warnings of an impending recession.
Spending on those two essentials - food and fuel – is bound, therefore, to come
under ever-closer scrutiny from the public. Shoppers are going to take far more
convincing that buying ‘organic’ is giving real value for money, tastes better, is
safer (whatever that means), and is doing less damage to the planet. Just following a food fad, which I suspect has been responsible for much of the increase
in organic sales in recent years, will figure very low in their estimation.
I am not suggesting for one moment that ‘organic’ farming will vanish from
the countryside. Or that those farmers who are totally committed to the principles of organic production will not continue to accept all the legal constraints
and inspections that are now required (and becoming increasingly expensive),
to use the ‘organic’ label. But I do think that, over time, sales of organic food
will revert to being principally through farm shops, farmers markets, weekly
veggie boxes and, increasingly, the Internet. The direct link to the farmer is
possibly much off the attraction – impersonal organic produce, stacked high on
the supermarket shelves, hardly endears itself to the average shopper.
So why do I think the Soil Association has any influence on the decisions
supermarkets make about what products are worthy of valuable shelf-space?
The main reasons for farming organically, which are preached with almost religious fervour by the acolytes of the movement, are being steadily eroded by
Government diktat.
Firstly, the regulations on animal welfare in all farming vary nowadays only
in emphasis from organic principles. Even rules governing the treatment of cats,
dogs and horses look likely to be tightened up if the new DEFRA consultation is
anything to go by. Perhaps the long-term future of that other crusading charity,
the RSPCA, is at risk. Then there is the public concern that bag nitrogen
is being chucked about indiscriminately, damaging the soil and polluting our
waterways. The recent widening of the area to almost all of our farmed land,
which is now governed by the strict Nitrogen Vulnerable Zones measures, makes
it difficult to imply that it is only organic farmers that are behaving responsibly
in the use of synthetic fertilisers.
And now the real and possibly only legitimate worry that modern farming
methods might be detrimental to the nation’s health – the excessive use of
so-called dangerous pesticides – is in the headlines. Even with my somewhat
cynical attitude to organic farming, I have to concede that here there may be
a case to answer. But if the EU has its way and severly restricts the sprays
522

that are considered safe to use, food prices will inevitably be affected. I see
that the Soil Association policy director, Peter Melchett, has called on the UK
Government to stop opposing these measures, which he claims will go some way
to improve the safety of humans and wildlife. Bold words, but will the public
jump to the conclusion that if anything remotely hazardous has been eliminated
from our food, the most potent reason for buying organic has disappeared.

November 19th
Moving Over for the Young
The farmland around us is interspersed with sizeable areas of oak woodland –
almost certainly the remnants of ancient forest that once covered all this part
of North Devon. There are traces of an Iron Age Fort about a mile to the north
of us on the higher slopes of the neighbouring farm. Three thousand years ago
the first settlers must have had the massive task of clearing the oak trees to
create farmable land. It is not difficult to visualise which fields were laid out
first, and why some steeper hillsides were left untouched.
But I sometimes wonder if those early farmers looked out across the landscape at this time of year and marvelled, as we do today, at the extraordinary
variation in the fading greens to rich browns of the oak leaves in the weak autumn sunlight. Or did they, as I suspect, view these colour changes merely as a
sign that the year was dying and fret that the leaves weren’t falling fast enough
to let them get on with the job felling the oaks before winter set in. Nowadays
we seem to be more concerned about damaging our environment than producing
food. In those days it must have been a perpetual battle with the wilderness to
survive, but at least there was always space available for the next generation to
make a start.
Today the problem of devising a way of helping young farmers into the
industry is almost insoluble, given the huge cost of purchasing agricultural land
and the scarcity of suitable farms to rent. I was very struck, therefore, by a
suggestion made by my old friend and neighbour, Jim Stephens. It came up
at the recent farmer meeting at Stoodleigh Court near Tiverton with the EU
Farms Commissioner, Marian Fischer Boel. She seemed to be more interested
in hearing about the difficulties we face with the electronic sheep-tag proposals
coming out of Brussels, and our disgust at the way our own government is
handling bovine TB, than telling us about her plans for the future direction of
the CAP.
However, one nugget of information Marian Fischer Boel did disclose was
her intention to increase modulation (slicing a percentage off every farmer’s
523

2008
Single Farm Payment) and make it a progressive tax, with larger farms paying
at a higher rate than smaller ones. At present Britain is already paying at a
higher rate than the rest of Europe, which is one inequality among many others
that needs correcting, but her argument that it would be fair because bigger
farms are more likely to use modulation funds for environmental schemes I find
doubtful. It was at that point that Jim Stephens suggested farmers might accept
increases in modulation, progressive or otherwise, if the money was used to help
new entrants to the industry. The idea certainly seemed to find favour with the
farmers present. I know it would be difficult to implement, and has been tried
before without much success, but it should certainly be explored further.
The subject was the focus of a speech made the following evening by Peter
Reed, Chairman of the Devon Federation of Young Farmers’ Clubs at the Devon
NFU Centenary Dinner. It was in reply to the toast to the NFU proposed by the
President, Peter Kendall, which naturally harked back over the past 100 years.
Peter Reed just as naturally and as befits the voice of the next generation of
Devon farmers, spoke only of the future. He told us about the recent trip to
Tanzania made by a group of Young Farmers to install a pipeline, the trench
dug by hand using a motley collection of tired spades and shovels. This will
bring water a considerable distance from a river to supply the cattle of a village,
where previously all was carried (as usual in Africa) by the women.
Peter closed with a heart-felt plea for a way to be devised whereby young
would-be farmers could get the chance to take on land no longer farmed to
its full potential by retiring farmers winding down. I hope the suggestion is
taken back by the NFU president and turned into a workable proposal using
modulation money, which can be put to the EU commission and incorporated
into the future management of the CAP. That would be a real and fitting way
to celebrate the NFU’s centenary.

Ignorance on Animal Welfare
Letters to the press concerning the welfare of farm animals often show a surprising degree of ignorance about what actually goes on down on the farm.
From the way they are written, I suspect the more outraged examples are from
well-meaning individuals who have only recently come to live in the countryside
and are comparatively new to rural life.
I am reminded of the true story of the woman who took a job in the neighbouring town. She noticed as she commuted to work in the mornings that a
herd of cows were being kept in rather crowded conditions standing on an area
524

Nov 26th

Ignorance on Animal Welfare

of bare concrete. When she returned home in the evenings the cows were always
still there, and thinking, not unnaturally, that this was a somewhat inhumane
way to look after cattle, she eventually reported the matter to the RSPCA. The
local inspector visited the farm and discovered, as I am sure you have guessed,
that the cows were merely waiting their turn to enter the milking parlour for
morning or evening milking.
Fortunately, on this occasion there was a happy outcome. The farmer insisted that the RSPCA inspector made the woman who had complained visit
the farm and see for herself how comfortably the animals were actually housed.
But the incident could so easily have resulted in one more letter to the Times
from Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells spouting off about the cruelty involved in
modern-day livestock husbandry.
Not that it ends there. There seems to be a widespread belief that animals
in the wild generally lead happy and stress free lives. Today’s popular TV films
showing the life histories of individual species, tend to promote the idea that,
apart from occasionally being the quarry of a larger and stronger predator, life
is a bed of roses. This was brought home to me the other day by a TV presenter
introducing some wildlife programme with the words that “It is when animals
come up against man that they are in danger”. What nonsense – animals in
the wild are constantly in danger, never able to relax and forever on the alert
to the threat posed by other species. And if they fall ill or are injured, they
rarely have time to recover before succumbing to the attentions of some animal
they would normally have no difficulty avoiding.
Domesticated animals on the other hand really do have a better quality of
life. With surprisingly few exceptions, which inevitably make headline news,
farms provide them with everything they need. They have no worries about
where their next meal is coming from. They are housed against the winter
weather in buildings vastly better today than even as recently as 50 years ago.
When ill or injured, farm animals are treated almost immediately by farmer
or vet and can be vaccinated against diseases that would certainly kill them in
the wild. We can nowadays even control complaints like footrot, that perennial
and painful scourge of lowland sheep, with the use of a vaccine. Hopefully that
will see an end to that other true story about the farmer, who asked by his vet,
“When did your sheep first show signs of lameness?” replied: “1928, when my
grandfather brought the flock onto the farm.”
When it comes to relaxing, the real evidence of a carefree life, I have sometimes over the years come upon a cow, a sheep or a pig fast asleep in the open
field in the middle of the day, which was so laid back it needed a prod to make
525

2008
sure it wasn’t dead. I doubt if any wild animal sleeps as soundly as that, unless
hibernating.
However there is one area of animal welfare that I have touched on in the
past and about which I am far from happy. Most animals, farmed and wild, are
killed long before reaching a ripe old age. Sixty years ago, there were small local
slaughterhouses in market towns, most villages had adequate facilities behind
the butcher’s shop, and animals were routinely slaughtered on the farm. Today,
because of the expensive regulations that govern modern life, small slaughterhouses have become large abattoirs and animals are too often transported
ridiculous distances, when they could as easily be killed humanely at or close
to home. Support from the letter-writing public along those lines is far more
likely to meet with the approval of farmers everywhere.

Why Does DEFRA Veto Applications?
I have never been a member of a political party. For me, the thought that
feelings of loyalty might in some way influence my vote at a general election
is a complete turn off. I don’t much like our present system of confrontational
government anyway, probably because, as an impressionable teenager during
the war years, I grew up under a coalition government, which seemed to work
pretty well. Certainly, for an industry like agriculture, which is so long term
as to become a way of life, cross-party agreement to reach a consensus on
regulations affecting farming might well serve the nation better.
I had no qualms, therefore, about joining a Conservative gathering last
Saturday to hear what Daniel Kawczynski, the youthful Conservative MP for
Shrewsbury & Atcham, had to say about Bovine TB. Apparently, within a year
of entering Parliament in 2005, he had set up an All Party Parliament Group
for Dairy Farming – obviously someone who does not let the grass grow under
his feet. With a largely rural constituency, where bTB poses as great a threat
to livestock farms as it does to us here in the South West, and as the chair of
this powerful group of nearly 200 MPs (representing 11 million voters), surely,
surely he could persuade the government that the disease has to be tackled on
all fronts including in the main wildlife reservoir of badgers.
The answer was not encouraging. Mr Kawczynski seems convinced that the
DEFRA Secretary Hilary Benn will never change his position on badgers, whatever the scientific evidence for taking action. He promised that a Conservative
government, when elected, would deal with TB in badgers to meet the current
crisis in the spread of this disease.
526

Dec 3rd

Why Does DEFRA Veto Applications?

I am afraid that waiting for two more years is not an option. This is no
longer a crisis – that occurred ten years ago. The present situation is best
described as obscene. We are now slaughtering thousands upon thousands of
apparently healthy cattle, (the number is rising every year), which may or may
not be harbouring TB. Taxpayers’ money is used to compensate farmers, often
inadequately, for the loss of the animals, but with no consideration for the
damage and deep distress inflicted on what are often small family businesses.
This is horrific enough for the farming community, but it is totally unacceptable that society seems prepared to allow increasing numbers of wildlife,
mainly badgers, to suffer a lingering painful death because we haven’t the guts
to do what is necessary. No one disputes that TB passes between cattle and
badgers in both directions, but apportioning blame gets us nowhere. Nor do
I wish to see a wholesale cull, taking out too many healthy badgers with the
diseased animals over vast tracts of the countryside, as suggested by eminent
professors, who can’t even agree between themselves.
Why, then, are we prevented from using the badger protection legislation to
do exactly what was intended when it was introduced – to prevent the unnecessary suffering of badgers, originally from badger-baiting with dogs, but just as
relevant now with the uncontrolled spread of TB? Why are DEFRA instructed
to refuse every application for a licence, as permitted in the Act, to take out
infected badger setts on farms where the disease is constantly recurring, and
where badgers are obviously implicated? If a licence were required to take out
a badger sett that was undermining the foundations of a house on the fringes
of a town, I have no doubt it would be granted immediately.
The excuse that it is difficult to be sure which setts are infected overlooks
the research that was undertaken by Warwick University three years ago, which
proved that the TB bacillus is easily located in the soil and latrines near a
sett. The research showed that in areas of Gloucestershire, where TB in cattle
is widespread, 100 per cent of the setts were contaminated, but in Oxfordshire where TB is not a problem, there were no contaminated setts. If Daniel
Kawczynski can use the strength of his all-party Group to persuade Parliament
that DEFRA must be allowed to resume issuing licenses and oversee the removal
of badgers from farms where all other measures have failed, precisely what was
done very successfully 30 years ago, we shall perhaps at last begin to get this
nightmare under control. And, who knows, I might even vote Conservative at
the next election.

Bank Rate Returns to 2 Per Cent
I was dozing in front of the fire, half-listening to the TV evening news as the
cut in Bank Rate was being announced last week, when I was roused from
my inertia by the comment that, at 2 per cent, it was the lowest it has been
since November 1951. It is strange how just a few words can sometimes jog
the memory. It took me straight back to the Christmas of that year and the
calculations that John and I were making to decide if we could afford a mortgage
to buy this farm.
We were a couple of greenhorn college boys, who had pooled our slender
resources to try and get a start in farming. By the following February we had
persuaded a local Building Society to lend us, at 2 per cent over Bank Rate,
enough money to make an offer. The farm was ours. Looking back now it seems
a minuscule amount (£4000 at 4 per cent - £160 a year) for a 120acre farm, but
at the time it felt like a mill stone round our necks. Three years later we were
both married and John had moved on to farm in West Devon.
In due course, Jenny and I transferred to the AMC, a government sponsored
body set up for the agricultural industry, and took out a larger mortgage at
a fixed rate of 5.5 per cent, with an annual repayment included. This was an
ideal way to manage the loan and worked as a fixed rent, which never varied
over the years but seemed to shrink with inflation. It was finally paid off and
we got the deeds to the farm in 2003.
Financially, it was probably the best thing we ever did. Had we been able
to avoid starting an overdraft with the bank, initially to make essential repairs
to the farmhouse, we would probably be very wealthy today. It is easy to forget, especially when you are young and ambitious, that overdrafts are virtually
impossible to dislodge. You can offset interest against tax, but unless you sell
assets, any money you repay has to come out of profit, and on that you can’t
dodge the taxman.
Over the years, as our overdraft got bigger, bank rate climbed as well, so
that when we were advised by our then bank manager in the late 1970s that
we were approaching negative equity and should consider selling up, the Bank
Rate had reached the all time high of 17 per cent. I am still not sure if it was
the Bank Rate that was beating us or whether I was just a duff farmer. Our
bank manager was no great shakes either – one of his arguments against our
continuing to farm was that bank rates would never return to single figures in
my lifetime. If he is still alive, I would enjoy meeting him, if only to hear his
explanation for the negative equity that afflicts the nation today.
528

Considering Computer Predictions

I am, of course, being a little unfair to the six or seven bank managers we
have seen off since I came here. We did, after all, borrow money for a purpose
and not just to keep our creditors at bay. If you asked me where it all went,
I would point to the present farm buildings, none of which existed before we
came, with particular emphasis on the areas of concrete on which most of the
winter work relies. A history of the farm since the war could almost be written
around the purchase and laying of concrete.
In 1950 there was very little concrete flooring in the farm buildings in Devon
- they were all beautifully cobbled, as were most of the open yards. The shippens
were the exception but ours, holding eleven cows, had only been completed the
year before we arrived. There was no other concrete on this farm. Milking
parlours, collecting yards, cow cubicles and feeding passages changed all that.
Our steep approach road had to be concreted for the milk tanker, slurry pits
and silage clamps required impervious floors to avoid pollution.
We have added very little to the buildings in the last 15 years. They would
have needed a lot spending on them had we continued dairy farming, but have
served us well enough for beef and sheep. Our overdraft may have brought us
to the brink of disaster, but the improvements we made then are paying us
back now. That is surely the direction the government should be taking in the
present crisis. I agree wholeheartedly with those who believe that, rather than
baling out the banks, borrowed money should be used constructively to invest
in the nation’s infrastructure and generate employment.

December 17th
Considering Computer Predictions
In the not too distant future, UK farmers may find themselves in the unusual
situation of being asked to massively increase food production to help feed a
hungry world, regardless of the damage this might inflict on biodiversity. This
possibility crossed my mind as I listened to Professor Les Firbank introducing
a workshop discussion at North Wyke near Okehampton last week.
This is a new project designed to explore ‘biodiversity and other beneficial
impacts of organic conversion in the hills and uplands’ which is being undertaken by Aberystwyth University on behalf of DEFRA, hosted on this occasion
by North Wyke Research. Professor Firbank, as Head of Site, suggested that
we should not overlook in our deliberations the latest computer generated predictions about climate change. These indicate that the temperate regions best
suited to farming are shifting northwards, eventually making southern areas of
529

2008
Canada and Russia together with Northern Europe, the most important foodproducing regions on the planet.
We are all aware how difficult life is becoming for hill-farmers, those unyielding families, who make a living managing our moors and mountains, wetlands
and less favoured areas. As something that impacts on large sections of the
public, who enjoy these wild open areas of Britain, DEFRA is obviously attempting to find ways of increasing the funding to these farms under existing
support schemes. Whether the organic conversion scheme is the ideal method,
and how much it will maintain, let alone improve biodiversity is open to conjecture.
The two farmer speakers at the workshop were both already farming organically, one on the eastern fringes of Exmoor and the other on the heavy wetland
near Hatherleigh in Devon. I got the impression that selling direct to the public
was the overriding factor that kept them profitable. Did the word organic add
anything to the natural image of their produce to boost sales? Because eventually, I presume, we shall all, upland and lowland farmers alike, have to make
a living without direct subsides such as the Single Farm Payment, and be paid
only for undertaking specific environmental work to benefit biodiversity.
I hesitate to pontificate about hill farming – I have found it hard enough
farming beef and sheep in the lowlands, but I did learn a little during my time
as an NFU officeholder attending hill-farm committee meetings and open days
on moorland farms. So it was natural that I should turn to Peter Crozier, a
friend since those days when he was one place above me in the Devon NFU
pecking order, to shed some light on the subject.
Peter and Anne Crozier farm some of the highest land on Dartmoor. Although Prince Charles is their landlord, they have never considered going organic. I gather the same is true of the majority of Duchy farms on the moor.
The reason is surprisingly simple. In order to make a reasonable living (and
pay the rent), it is essential to have sufficient ploughable acres to grow the extra fodder needed to take their stock through the winter, which is why most
moorland farmers own or rent lowland farms. Without the use of inorganic fertiliser on these acres, the number of animals necessary to control the moorland
vegetation would be severly restricted. And the cost of purchasing organic feed
would be prohibitive.
In the past, the way of stocking the uplands was reversed, with the livestock
being owned by lowland farmers, who paid to have their store cattle taken up
onto the moor between March and September. This allowed the animals to put
on extra growth throughout one summer of their lives, to be finished in their
third year on the farms where they were born. The system worked well, with
530

Will the Big Freeze of 1963 Be Repeated?

the moorland farmers claiming the headage payments when they were available
on these cattle. It wouldn’t be possible today, since most beef animals need to
be ready for slaughter at 24 months.
The future for upland farms seems very uncertain at present, but who
knows? If we do eventually have to grow crops on every available acre to feed
the world, hill farms may come into their own as the only areas where farmed
animals are allowed to graze. And grass fed beef and lamb could well end up
worth its weight in gold.

December 31st
Will the Big Freeze of 1963 Be Repeated?
It was snowing heavily, but I was nearly home. In four-wheel drive I was making
good headway, but each time I passed a gateway, the snowdrifts blowing out
of the fields across the road were getting higher. I had charged successfully
through three or four, but the one now looming in my headlights looked to be
above the bonnet. I was also on a slight uphill incline, but I put my foot down
and hoped for the best. The Austin Gipsy, a Landover type vehicle, ploughed
into the snow, slowed up and with the wheels spinning, slid gently sideways to
end up resting against the hedge.
It was December 30th, 1962, the start of one of the greatest blizzards ever
to hit the Westcountry. I walked the last mile back to my in-laws, where we
had been staying over Christmas. I would have walked much further than that,
town shoes and best suit not withstanding – the circumstances were unfortunate
enough as it was. I had been obliged to leave Jenny for a couple of days to be
at my brother’s wedding near Reading. Our seven-year-old daughter, Catherine, was to be a bridesmaid and needed accompanying on the train journey.
Although there was a dusting of snow when we left, there was no forecast of
blizzards.
Arriving back at Exeter Station, some large flakes of wet snow greeted us,
settling on the pavement but melting immediately. With no indication of what
was to come, we set off for home, but by the time we reached Crediton, visibility
was down to a few yards and it was getting dark. I didn’t relish the thought
of getting stuck and having to carry Cath any distance through snowdrifts, so
I dropped her off at my sister-in-law’s, with a promise that I would pick her up
the following day.
We usually spent Christmas with my in-laws when the children were small.
Although six miles apart by road, the farms were adjacent and it was no problem
to walk across the fields morning and evening for a few days to milk the cows
531

2008
and do the yard work. But this year was different. Although our youngest child,
Melanie, had been born just thirty days earlier, Jenny said she would do the
milking with the help of a neighbour while I was away. I suppose I should have
given up the idea of getting to the wedding, but it would have been a shame if
Cath had missed the chance of being a bridesmaid.
But at the time, I was very worried that I might be prevented from getting
home at all that night, with Jenny having to struggle through snowdrifts the
following morning to milk the cows. Mains electricity had reached the district
the previous summer, and we had installed a milking parlour near the farmhouse, which made the job much easier. But there was still a lot to do, with
more than 35 cows to milk and a growing number of young stock to feed.
I went back the next day to dig the Gipsy out of the snowdrift, but there
was no sign of it - it was completed buried. I retrieved it some days later, when
the council finally arrived to get traffic moving. I didn’t manage to pick up
Cath, much to her indignation, for another fortnight.
There was a further ferocious blizzard in early January, which completely
filled with snow the two miles of lane to our farm. To add to our problems, when
the bulldozer eventually arrived to clear the main road, the driver was new to
the district and unaware that our lane led anywhere. Hearing what sounded
like a large machine working in the distance, I walked out to find that the chap,
instead of letting us out, was actually shoving snow up into our lane, making
a solid barrier 15 feet high for about 30 yards in. This froze solid and the
council eventually had to cut a narrow entrance through it, which resembled an
enlarged section of the Cresta Run. Driving out of the lane became a hazardous
undertaking, with a car sliding and bouncing off the sidewalls as it gathered
speed out into the main road. Most of it remained until the beginning of May.
I regret that I never kept a diary, but I do remember that the January and
February were pretty traumatic - and it all began exactly 46 years ago to the
day as I write. Shall we ever get a repeat? I doubt it, but it did start with a
week of freezing easterly winds, very much as we have had this year. Roll on
January 1st and some warmer weather.

Jumping One Hoop Too Far?
I have a feeling that some of the clever people, who get themselves appointed
to advise government on farming matters, will sooner or later fall flat on their
faces. Many of them are well meaning academics who, when confronted by
microphones or television cameras, spout carefully chosen phrases to make disturbing headlines. I assume that agriculture ministers, in setting up the various
committees (often designed to delay urgent decisions until they are no longer
relevant), keep lists of possible candidates who have caught the public eye in
this way, and who will be readily accepted as experts.
Perhaps I am being a little harsh, but it is obvious to most of us that the
agricultural policy produced by these advisory bodies often ends in disaster.
The trouble arises because there are few if any working farmers included in the
deliberations from the outset - all we are expected to contribute are reasons why
we find the resulting schemes too expensive or too impractical to implement.
There usually follows a bit of horse-trading between the government and farmer
organisations like the NFU, a few minor concessions made to save face on both
sides, and we are told that we have achieved the best possible outcome in the
circumstances. And down on the farm, we are left to shoulder the extra burden
and consider ourselves lucky.
This is nothing new. Farming has been saddled with ridiculous political
decisions for generations. One of the classic occasions occurred at the end of
the Great War and is described by Cecil Torr in his “Small Talk at Wreyland”.
Apparently, in order to increase food production, a notice was issued to farmers
in 1918 that 35 per cent of every holding must be ploughed to grow corn and
potatoes and that “substitution of quota from one holding to another will not
be allowed under any circumstances”.
533

2009
The stupidity was that in parishes like Wreyland on the edge of Dartmoor,
much of the land was poor pasture – quite unfit for ploughing, in some cases not
even yielding sufficient to recover the cost of the seed, and unlikely to revert to
pasture for many years afterwards. And on other farms, where 65 per cent of the
land was fit to plough, they ploughed no more than the specified 35. Cecil Torr
goes on to point out that the Executive Committee for Devon had the details
of cropping for every parish in the county from the Tithe maps of 1836, when
“every available acre was growing corn or potatoes wherever it was possible to
grow them, as they were paying crops – the fools could easily have seen what
was arable then and based their regulations upon that”. The Committee may
have achieved the required number of acres ploughed, but they never produced
the quantity of crops that were actually needed.
Nothing changes. There are, at present, an unusually large number of unfortunate policy decisions hanging over us. Some are already here, like the
extension of the Nitrate Vulnerable Zones and the electronic identification of
sheep, both extremely expensive to implement and adding very little if any
benefit to the environment or to sheep farmers. Others, like DEFRA’s intention to reinstate some level of set-aside, impose cost sharing for disease control,
but avoid introducing a supermarket ombudsman to ensure fair trading, are all
decisions that look like being made without much farmer input.
And we now have a Council of Food Policy Advisers, set up, so it is said,
to “overhaul the governments approach to the subject” – whatever that means.
Ominously, an eminent professor who has recently been named as a leading
light on this new group has already gone out on a limb, presumably without
consulting his fellows. He is quoted as saying that the government has to intervene to force through policy changes to the way Britain feeds itself, particularly
with regard to eating meat. I suspect the public are not quite ready to be told
what we are allowed to eat or what we are permitted to grow.
If the professor has any ideas like setting figures for how much land every
farmer must plough up on which to grow vegetables, he should be warned that
we have been jumping through hoops on government orders for years. For many
of us this would be one hoop too far.

Problems of Farming Popularity

January 14th
Problems of Farming Popularity
I am rather uncomfortable with some research findings, which seem to show
that the British public has a very high opinion of farmers. We are ranked with
nurses and doctors as one of the hardest working occupations. Very flattering,
but hardly surprising when you consider that we are often depicted in the media
driving combines through the night to salvage a weather-delayed harvest or
staggering out of the snow-covered hills with a near-dead sheep under each
arm. Oh, we certainly work hard enough, but are we really in the same league
as the medical profession?
But my disquiet arises from wondering if the work ethic as a measure of popularity is all that important for a successful farming industry. It is obviously
better than finding oneself listed at the bottom of the table with estate agents,
high street bankers, journalists and civil servants, all of whom apparently do
very little (if any) work at all, according to public perception. Including journalists among the work-shy seems a little harsh, which makes me a trifle suspicious
of the accuracy of the research.
The Institute of Grocery Distribution (IGD), which undertook this research
for the recent Oxford Farming Conference, was founded 100years ago (strangely
enough making it exactly the same age as the NFU). It should therefore have
ample experience of asking the right questions of the food buying public to
measure how farmers stack up. And I see that according to the IGD chief
executive Joanne Denney-Finch, who spoke at the conference, we stack up very
well at the present time.
The research showed that nearly 90% of the 1000 people questioned thought
farmers deserved the full support of the public, and a similar number felt that
Britain should be more self-sufficient in food. Somewhat ambiguously, 80% said
we should get better prices from the supermarkets, but 79% believed that food
was too expensive and farmers could do more to cut the price of food in the
shops, which rather suggests that only 1% of those questioned bothered to think
carefully about their answers. I could be cynical and query whether 1000 people
was a large enough sample and ask where the research took place – Manchester
or Birmingham perhaps, or in more rural cities like Exeter or Truro.
My farming career started as the war ended when food was still in short
supply. Everyone was heartily sick of rationing, and the drive to increase food
production was of national importance. I don’t think popularity came into it
– in fact, if I remember correctly, there was a slight feeling of resentment that
535

2009
agriculture had been a reserved occupation and that farmers had never been
desperately short of food.
However, farming under a system of guaranteed prices, whilst subsidising the
cost of food in the shops, and therefore effectively keeping the wages of factory
workers to a minimum, did get results - the proportion of home produced food
increased rapidly without damaging our vital car exports. But over time, as
some of our weaker industries went to the wall, envy over the apparent security
we gained from the annual farm price review produced from a disgruntled urban
MP that evocative and much hated jibe of ‘featherbed farmers’.
In the years that followed, our approval rating with the public went rapidly
downhill. We were guilty of rural vandalism and the wholesale destruction of
wild life through intensive farming. Bulldozing hedges almost became a hanging
offence. Arable farmers gained the dubious title of ‘barley barons’ who only
drove large four by fours and spent their winters in the Caribbean. Livestock
farmers were accused of treating their animals as mere units in a production
chain – hence the term factory farming. And much of this criticism was justified.
But it was conveniently overlooked that by the 1970s, we had increased food
production to a level never seen before in Britain, while the cost of food in the
shops had never been lower, relative to average income. We had done what we
had been asked to do, but a great many smaller farmers had not survived the
experience.
If the IGD research is accurate, it looks as if we may be starting a new
chapter in British farming. Mrs Denny-Finch is certainly right in encouraging
us to keep the public with us this time.

New Life for Oldest Hedgerow
Possibly the longest growing hedgerow on the farm has finally had the chop.
In case the hedge-police start jumping to the wrong conclusion, I had better
explain that we haven’t demolished a hedge – just used a chainsaw, axe and
billhook to plash it, hopefully to last another 80years.
I am only guessing at the time span, since this particular hedge has never
been laid-in since I first came, and it looked pretty overgrown then. In fact,
it was lucky to escape being bulldozed at the time as it divided two extremely
steep north-facing fields. According to the 1840s tithe map, both fields were
once arable, which was quite feasible working with horses, but I only had a small
grey Fergie in those days. Before 4-wheel-drive tractors came on the scene (I
was one of the first farmers locally to invest in one), these two fields were only fit
536

Jan 21st

New Life for Oldest Hedgerow

for grazing. Even topping them was a pretty hairy business but had I removed
the hedge, working them as one field across the slope would have been far safer.
Anyway, the hedge survived and is now being laid-in again by David, who
worked for us for many years and is a most competent hedger. He has been
prevailed on to come out of retirement in recent winters to tackle the hedges
that are part of our Stewardship Scheme. This has only a couple more years
to run, and the hedging is almost finished. But unexpectedly last autumn, Jim
had an offer from Natural England to add something to our scheme if it could
be completed by the end of February – presumably there is money available
which needs to be spent before the end of the financial year. Although this
hedgerow has never been high on Jim’s agenda seeing the state it was in with
sheep and cattle wandering through it at will, it was too good an opportunity
to miss if only to get it properly fenced.
Strangely enough, while this may be the last of the hedges on the farm
that needs rejuvenating, Jim will, this springtime, be planting up with suitable
hedgerow trees and shrubs a new hedge bank that is bordering a newly planted
orchard. When complete, this will replace one of the hedges I did bulldoze
out all those years ago in order to make another steep field, in this case a
good south facing arable field, workable with a two-wheel drive tractor. In the
distant future it is doubtful if anyone checking the old tithe map will guess
that for over 50years this particular hedgerow disappeared, allowing farming to
continue safely with the machinery available at the time.
You will deduce from all this that I do not exactly venerate English hedgerows.
I was dismayed when the hedgerow protection legislation was introduced in
1997. By all means preserve the really ancient hedges that have an historical
importance, but a blanket restriction on all hedges over 30years old is absurd.
Many are only the result of the enclosures, which replaced strip-cultivation, and
go back only two or three centuries. These were originally just planted with
hawthorn in straight lines to mark out the new fields, with considerable public
opposition.
Our forebears have been eliminating or moving them to suit an ever changing
agriculture until twelve years ago. Now they are preserved in some kind of
agricultural time warp, often thrashed to within an inch of their lives by modern
hedge trimmers as the only way left to preserve them with a much reduced work
force.
And I seriously question whether today’s hedges are doing the job for which
they were intended. They are hardly a protection against the elements and no
longer act as a proper substitute for woodland edge to benefit wildlife. As for
enhancing the beauty of the English countryside, try standing on a decent hill
537

2009
and look out over a large area of farmland. The woods and trees are still there,
but hedges in the various stages of growth of a twenty to thirty year rotation
have mostly disappeared. We are left with plain regular unchanging borders to
the fields, and nothing to wax lyrical about.
I would like to see many of our unnecessary hedges removed and replaced
with a few very much wider hedgerows, growing upwards for fifty or more years
and acting as woodland corridors. That would be something worthwhile to offer
generations to come.

January 28th
No More Rewards to Leaders
Like most farmers, I am an optimist - it goes with the job. How else would we
survive, seeing the weather plays such a large part in our lives? But I have to
confess that towards the end of January my optimism is generally pushed to
the limit, and this year is no exception. We’ve had southerly gales and heavy
rain alternating with spells of freezing daylong temperatures for much of the
last two months. Sunshine has been pretty infrequent and I think our fields are
now as wet as I have ever known them.
Last week, something spooked the small group of in-calf cows that we keep
out every winter on our hill. They seemed very agitated one morning, and were
reluctant to come for their hay. It is possible a walker with a dog using the
public footpath through the field or our small herd of resident wild deer trying
to share their food had stirred them up, but what ever the cause some of the
cows were sufficiently upset to flatten a gate that evening and make for the
other end of the farm. Looking for cows in the dark is not a welcome addition
to the winter chores.
We also discovered that our mains water supply appears to have sprung a
leak. We are suddenly using twice our normal quantity, and with no visible leak,
and no loss of water pressure, the problem has to be somewhere underground.
There are nearly two miles of piping to check for a weeping joint or split in
the polythene - a daunting task at the best of times. With so much rainwater
flowing in every direction, a completely burst pipe would be easier to locate.
Jim has introduced a number of stopcocks into the system to allow sections
to be isolated for just this contingency, but I doubt if he sees January as the
ideal month for going around the farm digging holes in the ground to put things
right.
To add to my feeling of gloom, I now see that our esteemed Secretary of
State, Hilary Benn has been at it again – saying one thing but meaning some538

Jan 28th

No More Rewards to Leaders

thing very different. This time, he is so concerned that we should believe him
when he says he wants “British agriculture to produce as much food as possible
- no ifs, no buts”, that he repeats the phrase, which he first used at the recent
Oxford Farming Conference, in statements and letters to the farming press.
Mr Benn surely cannot think that farmers are so naive as to be taken in like
that. We all know that he will allow us to produce as much as we like, but with
“ifs” and “buts” hampering us at every turn. We must avoid damaging the
natural environment, which is difficult since, on farmed land, producing food is
the natural environment. To keep us on side, while mollifying the green lobby,
especially the RSPB with its fixation about farmland bird numbers, Mr Benn
has one of his advisory committees dreaming up a return to set aside, but using
another name, while our European competitors have abandoned the restriction
altogether.
And Mr Benn’s support for the individual sectors also seems as negative
as ever. For arable, he is not prepared to lobby his fellow European ministers
against the proposed spray ban, although he accepts there is little real evidence
that human health will benefit from its introduction. Nor is there any sign that
he is making an effort to reduce red tape, if DEFRA’s latest manual about the
new nitrogen regulations running to nine booklets, is anything to go by.
The imminent introduction of electronic identification for sheep, an unnecessary added expense for lamb producers, could be delayed. Cattle farmers will
continue having to slaughter a criminal number of healthy cows, in case they
are harbouring TB, while the best Mr Benn can do about TB in wildlife is the
promise of a badger vaccine within two years. Perhaps he can explain how vaccinating thousands of diseased badgers here in the southwest, will solve anything,
since vaccination is not a cure but only a protection for healthy animals.
Hopefully with February arriving at the end of the week, and spring just
around the corner, my gloom will lift. The minister could help by promising he
will not hand out knighthoods or peerages to farming leaders for good behaviour
while he’s in charge. That might encourage us to do more to help ourselves.

February 4th
Time to Bid Benn Goodbye
When it comes to dealing with unwelcome situations originating in Europe, we
really are the most pathetic of all the EU member states. I am not referring to
the seasonal weather that has, as usual, brought our major transport routes to
a virtual standstill. Heavy snow occurs so rarely here it would be far too costly
to keep the necessary emergency measures permanently on stand-by. By next
week, we shall probably be back to wind and rain, and all this will be forgotten.
No, what I am concerned about is our spineless reaction to misguided regulations emanating from Brussels. The latest proposal that recreational fishing
be included in the Common Fisheries Policy, with the catches of amateur sea
anglers included in national quotas, is so farcical that MEPs of all parties are
vying with each other to appear suitably outraged. They are attempting to get
the Commission to modify the intended regulation to make it appear acceptable.
If our MEPs are so united on this, why bother?
The simple solution is for our Fisheries Minister to announce that we will not
be implementing this particular regulation in the UK, since it would do nothing
for our fish stocks and would be unworkable in practice. That is precisely what
other member states would do and have, in fact, done in the past.
The Portuguese never implemented the regulations that prohibit the burial
of animals on farm, which they consider unwarranted in their circumstances.
The Italians altered the milk quota rules to suit themselves, since these did
not reflect conditions on the alpine pastures where some of their cows live all
summer, with the milk made directly into cheese, and never measured in litres.
The French make avoiding regulations that don’t suit them into a fine art.
They refused to accept our beef for months after it was cleared as perfectly
safe, although by then they had nearly as many cows going down with BSE as
we did. More recently, they ignored the changes to the farm support system, by
persisting in paying headage payments for suckler cows. I have no doubt there
are plenty of examples from all over Europe.
We treat our membership of the CAP as if we belong to some kind of Victorian gentlemen’s club, afraid of the ultimate indignity of being blackballed
and expelled if we break the rules. We make a point of gold plating unworkable
regulations to ensure we can enforce them. We are probably the laughing stock
of every civil service in the EU, since the possibility of being thrown out is
unthinkable. We are, with Germany, the only countries that contribute more
financially than we take out. Without us, the EU would collapse.
We are currently trying to persuade Brussels to back off imposing electronic
540

Feb 11th

This Most Unpleasant Weather

identification (EID) on our sheep industry. We have been given a derogation
that some sheep are more equal than others and can continue as now with plastic
ear tags. This has not unnaturally set farmers against livestock auctioneers,
who have the job of sorting sheep in the market place. Since we have more
sheep in the UK than there are in all the other member states put together,
you would assume that our concerns should carry weight. A clear case for our
DEFRA Secretary, Hilary Benn, who is in agreement with sheep farmers, to
inform Brussels that we shall not be introducing EID for the foreseeable future.
No ifs – no buts.
Similar action could be taken over the fungal-inhibiting sprays that are being phased out without proper research to verify their effect on human health,
something vitally important to crop yields in our damper climate. Will it happen – no way. Our present Secretary of State is as wet and ineffectual as any
I can remember. And there are other issues like bovine TB that need urgent
action.
The opposition parties are getting nowhere in their attempts to embarrass
Benn out of office. It is high time, therefore, for the NFU president, Peter
Kendall, to seek a meeting with the Prime Minister to demand the Secretary
of State’s immediate removal. Any reluctance on the part of Gordon Brown to
understand how seriously farmers view Benn’s continuing presence at DEFRA
should have the NFU President making a direct and outspoken approach to the
public. This may make him unpopular with the government, but that goes with
the job he was elected to do.

February 11th
This Most Unpleasant Weather
There was a time when I welcomed a spell of snow in February. I am not looking
back to my schooldays, but recalling my early farming years, when after a cold
dry January, we would wake up to a world turned white overnight, hiding the
yellowing grass and lying in folds on the furrows of the arable fields, ploughed
ready for spring corn, something rarely seen now.
It generally didn’t last long, a week at most, and heralded the onset of
warmer weather, with snowdrops and crocuses showing through the snow as it
melted and the grass appearing greener after a few days protection from the
frost.
Perhaps I am imagining it, but we used to get more short snowy spells in
those days than we have in the recent past. Oh, we had blizzard years, with
541

2009
strong winds and lanes blocked solid and we were glad to see the back of them,
but not as glad as I shall be to see the end of this prolonged on-off snowy spell.
If this is global warming, the weathermen can keep it.
There are two things that single it out as some of the most unpleasant winter
weather I can recall. The ground was saturated before it started, so that when
a proper thaw does sets in, the snowmelt will run straight off into the rivers, as
it is doing already with rain falling as I write. This will give no benefit to the
land as seems to be the case when snow melts gradually into dry winter soil.
I believe in the old days, German farmers used to wait for snow to arrive before ploughing, reckoning that ploughed under, it was as good as an application
of nitrogen fertilizer for the coming crops.
What the huge quantity of salt being spread on the roads will do to our rivers
when it eventually reaches them, I’ve no idea. Perhaps it is of no consequence
since it is never mentioned, but I am surprised, considering the fuss that is made
about anything ending up in a river that has originated on a farm.
The other unusual thing about this spell of atrocious weather is the extraordinary fluctuations in the wind, making it difficult to guess where the next
heavy fall of snow will occur. Usually it is possible to get an idea of what is
coming, regardless of the met office’s attempts to forecast more than two days
ahead, by the direction of the prevailing wind. In the last two weeks, there has
been no prevailing wind. We have had the wind coming at us from every point
of the compass, often swinging through 360 degrees in 24 hours. Here, in North
Devon, we have had heavy rain on a southerly wind all day and the forecast is
of a northerly blizzard reaching us overnight.
Hopefully, the forecast of better weather through the second half of the week
will be correct.
I know I shouldn’t be grumbling. Compared with the lethal forest fires engulfing thousands of homes in South Australia due to the unprecedented heat
wave, the horrors of which we are seeing daily on the news, we are extremely
lucky. Our lane has been passable with care on most days. We are only about
three miles from the village, which can be reached on foot. Who needs a supermarket ten miles away, when all the necessities, often obtained from local farms
and small businesses, are available in the village shop?
Thankfully, ours survived the post office closures of last year. Steve tells
me had he lost that part of his business, he would have been forced to close
altogether. He and his band of assistants have noticed an upturn in sales in the
last fortnight, with new customers appearing who don’t normally shop there.
It shows how vital it is to support a village shop, which is easily forgotten as
we fill our shopping trolleys from the supermarket shelves.
542

Feb 18th

Banker’s Clear View Refreshing

The weather may also have interfered with that bugbear of village shops –
the supermarket home-delivery service. I know Steve used to find it extremely
difficult to remain civil to the Tesco van driver, who parking outside, entered
the shop and obstructed customers, while he asked for directions to a list of
local householders. I believe he was eventually told what he could do with his
list. It’s an ill wind, as the saying goes, that blows nobody any good.

February 18th
Banker’s Clear View Refreshing
I found myself listening last week to a real live banker for the first time since
the wheels started falling off the nation’s high street banks. The occasion was
a meeting of the Devonshire Grassland Society, the guest speaker being Pat
Tomlinson, Head of Agriculture for HSBC UK, with responsibility for over 60
agriculture managers up and down the country.
Thankfully, Mr Tomlinson did not begin by making any well rehearsed,
grovelling and obviously insincere apology for the apparent incompetence and
greed of our leading bankers. This was something we witnessed on TV very
recently from four of the former bosses of the bailed-out banks, which will cost us
all an arm and a leg for years to come. In fact he had no reason to, since his own
bank seems to have come through the financial maelstrom relatively unscathed.
Perhaps HSBC was fortunate that many of its international acquisitions were
made twenty years ago, around the time it swallowed up our own Midland Bank.
Instead, Pat Tomlinson avoided making any comments about the present
unpopularity of his chosen profession, suggesting we could have a go at him, if
we so wished, during discussion following his presentation. He did, in passing,
point out that the function of a bank is to use the money deposited by customers
for the sole purpose of financing loans to other customers, always ensuring that
the rate of interest charged to borrowers exceeds the rate of interest paid to
lenders. This implied that using our money to play the world’s financial markets
is not good banking, although it fails to explain how the credit-worthiness of so
many borrowers has been overrated.
I found his review of the current financial position of the agricultural industry refreshingly clear and easy to follow, something professional advisors
so often manage to overload with sleep-inducing statistics. We are obviously
better placed than many industries to survive the looming depression, since people will always have to eat. Mr Tomlinson did, however, come to some rather
unexpected conclusions.
543

2009
He is concerned that although the most successful farmers are keeping production costs to an absolute minimum, we are allowing our retailers to include
Single Farm Payments in their calculation of a fair price. We should be careful
to ensure that the public understand that these payments are not intended to
keep down food prices, but are there to cover our management of the countryside
and higher welfare standards.
On the other hand, he considers that the recent profitability of farming
should keep us well in with our bank managers when looking to extend our
overdrafts. But he rather spoilt his argument by pointing out that these profits
are exactly matched by the sum of all the Single Farm Payments received by
the industry. He can hardly have it that there is one rule for banks and another
rule for retailers.
But what really surprised me was his suggestion that we were making a
grave mistake in encouraging people to believe that food self-sufficiency was
vital to the national interest. I thought we were just beginning to win that one,
with politicians from the Prime Minister down at last voicing their enthusiasm
for the concept.
In Mr Tomlinson’s opinion, that is no way to secure the long-term future
of British agriculture. He does not believe there is any real threat to our food
supplies and we will be restricting the future expansion of our industry if we
persist in this argument. The world is going to need more food, and if we
can grow it in this country, we are morally obliged to increase production to
supply those regions of the world where there is likely to be a shortfall. An
exciting prospect, but how we get that past our vociferous green lobby and
environmental charities is an altogether more daunting challenge.
I thoroughly enjoyed my evening out, and am seriously thinking of joining
the Devonshire Grassland Society if it will have me. If it can regularly secure
speakers of Pat Tomlinson’s calibre, who knows who might be addressing us
here in the Westcountry next winter in what may well turn out to be election
year.

Benn Gets It Wrong Yet Again

February 25th
Benn Gets It Wrong Yet Again
Lambing is over for another season, with the ewes and lambs enjoying a spell
of warm spring weather. My daughter-in-law, Bev, has just completed the
quickest lambing that I can recall, with nearly all the lambs born during the
last fortnight. She has also had a remarkable number of ewes producing triplets
this year, ten percent of the flock, which must be a record for us. Fortunately,
the very cold snowy conditions ended in time to allow the lambs to benefit from
a good start in life.
What effect this very wintry weather has had on the birdlife of the farm,
remains to be seen. The last time we noticed our resident barn owl out hunting
was in broad daylight one afternoon during the worst of the snow, obviously
hungry and being mobbed by a couple of crows. I hope she has survived. But
there certainly do not seem to be as many garden birds about as we normally
get in early spring.
More unusual this year is the almost total absence of flies. In recent years,
these have appeared in large numbers from the nooks and crannies of the farm
buildings, to be seen warming themselves on sunny days on every pale-coloured
wall. Does this indicate that insects generally have taken a hammering this
winter from the very low temperatures? Not that a reduction in fly numbers in
the coming summer will be anything but a blessing. But if this is the case, the
smaller farmland birds which are so dependant on insect life to have a successful
breeding season, may well show a noticeable decline in twelve months time. And
who will get the blame for this? Why, farmers, as usual.
Our DEFRA Secretary, Hilary Benn, is currently getting himself all fired up
to impose on farmers a replacement to set-side (taking a percentage of arable
land out of production), something that has been abandoned by the EU as
being no longer necessary to control grain surpluses. Mr Benn seems to have
made a big issue of this at the recent NFU Conference saying that “Concern
over farmland birds, which are at their lowest level on record, meant it was
important some land was left uncropped. They are not incidental to the life of
a farm; in fact they are a barometer of the health of the wider environment.
Like a canary down the mine, we ignore them at our peril”.
Now, on the face of it, this statement seems to me to be complete nonsense.
The kindest explanation I can offer is that Mr Benn was using a phrase suggested
by the RSPB for inclusion in his address. The RSBP loves the proposition that
the number of farmland birds acts as a measure of the health of the wider
environment. Poppycock! Farmland bird numbers merely indicate how much
545

2009
bird life can exist under current methods of farming. Mr Benn obviously intends
to make us take land out of production to give birds more space. But that
is hardly increasing the number of farmland birds – it is just providing an
alternative habitat to raise bird numbers artificially, particularly among those
species finding it difficult to survive on today’s farmed land. It could be argued
that, strictly speaking, these are no longer true farmland birds.
Farmers are in the business of producing food. We appreciate the wildlife
that surrounds us, but through the ages it has always been incidental to the job.
Certainly, there are landowners who can afford to farm in ways that actually
encourage wildlife, but that is a luxury denied to most of us. It is also true that
some forms of wildlife, chiefly insects, are essential to agriculture. We already
have schemes that provide incentives to care for the environment, and there is
no shortage of regulations which control how we manage the land.
But for politicians to arbitrarily decide how many birds we must accommodate on our farms, or face financial penalties, is bureaucracy gone mad. And to
take up to five percent of farmland out of production, which should be growing
food for a hungry world, and which is bound eventually to raise food prices at
a time when people are trying to economise, is surely something for the wider
public, rather than Mr Benn and the RSPB to have the final say.

March 4th
Benefits of Farming in the 1970s
I occasionally daydream about returning to a golden age of farming. I like to
think that it might once again be possible to get up in the morning, go out and
work on the farm and come in at night without ever, from one year’s end to the
next, having to lay a hand on pen, paper or ministry booklet.
I mention this because our annual organic Soil Association inspection is due
this month, closely followed by our annual TB test, and I have been clearing my
desk ready to have all the relevant paperwork available for scrutiny. In doing
so, I have uncovered some recent government instruction manuals, a couple of
hundred pages all told, which I have yet to read.
Ministry bumph usually gets a quick glance as it arrives in the post and is
then stacked at the side of the desk for dealing with at a later, sometimes a
much later date. However, doing this can sometimes come back to bite you,
when you discover you’ve missed some deadline before which a task should have
been completed or a form returned on pain of serious financial penalty or worse.
But things haven’t always been like this, as I discovered when reading a
fascinating little book called ‘The Diary of a Farmer’s Wife’, which Jenny found
546

Mar 4th

Benefits of Farming in the 1970s

recently in a second bookshop. It was written by a Herefordshire farmer’s wife,
called Anne Hughes and covers a short period of eighteen months from February
1796 to August 1797. The diary came down through her family and eventually
saw the light of day when it was serialised in the Farmers Weekly in 1937.
It is published exactly as written, with the spelling so erratic that I almost
had to read it aloud phonetically to understand it. But it is the most vivid
account of life on a farm 200 years ago that I have come across.
The actual day-to-day work on the farm was much the same as it is today,
so much so that I should have no difficulty in stepping back in time. It was
mainly an arable farm, one of the largest in the district, but obviously very
much smaller than today’s average Westcountry farm.
The lack of machinery would pose no problem, being replaced by itinerant
gangs (called foggers - a word new to me) hired for haymaking and harvesting,
and camping in one of the barns. There was a fulltime carter, a horseman and a
shepherd, with a young lad employed to help around the yard. The three milk
cows, some sows and a lot of poultry were looked after by husband John, Anne
and the maid, most of the produce being used for the house.
And that is where I should have a real problem. The amount of food they got
through was phenomenal. For example, the Sunday dinner cooked for a visit by
the parson and his wife consisted of their biggest ham, a saddle of mutton, three
capons, a round of spiced beef, and a roast stuffed hare. Added to that there
were ‘some tartes, a pritch pudden, cheese, butter and bredd, accompanied by
pertaties, greens ande other trymmings, wyth cyder, beere and sherrie wine toe
drynk’.
Anne seems to have prepared gargantuan meals like this on a regular basis.
Her diary includes complex recipes on nearly every page. Whether husband
John survived to a ripe old age must be doubtful, with a visit from the doctor
generally resulting in a routine bloodletting. But what I find extraordinary is
the complete lack of concern for the farm staff, which had to manage on a very
meagre diet. On one occasion, the shepherd is given a ram that has been struck
by lightning, with the comment that it will be a change for him, since he hasn’t
tasted meat for months.
What is more surprising is the total lack of contact with the outside world.
The French Revolution had just ended and that bogeyman, Napoleon, was
already marching across Europe, but no news, as there is today, of the world
collapsing around them. And apart from an approach to the local constable,
following a possible case of sheep rustling, there is no mention anywhere of
agricultural bureaucracy. Since Anne was obviously the scribe of the family,
you would expect some comment had there been ministry forms to fill out or
547

2009
inspections due. For that alone, I might be prepared to face all the food and
go back 200 years.

March 11th
How We Rebuilt Our Farm
If someone had told me on the day I opened a bank account with Lloyds, that at
some time in the future the bank might be nationalised, I should not have been
in the least surprised or concerned. After all, it was 1946, a Labour government
had been elected the year before and all the talk was about nationalisation. I
was a just student, and I needed a chequebook.
The Bank of England had been nationalised, and the other utilities - gas,
electricity, the railways, coal, iron and steel were soon to follow. There was even
talk, if I remember rightly, of nationalising the land, something with which, at
the time, I rather agreed. Hoping in due course to become a farmer and having
no capital to speak of, it looked a possible way into the industry - an agricultural
degree, followed by a successful application to some government department for
a starter farm, and a foot on that farming ladder, so well documented by George
and Frank Henderson.
Why I chose Lloyds Bank I have long forgotten. It was probably the only
bank that had a weekly presence in the small village in Surrey where I was living
at the time. I have maintained that original bank account, without a break, to
this day, although I confess that lately I have often been sorely tempted. But,
who knows, perhaps I was right to hang on – a few more months and I might
have been in line for a handout as one of Lloyds longest continuous account
holders. I must surely have made a bit more profit for the bank than some of
the executives now retiring with six-figure pensions.
However, that little bit of fantasy has now faded with what is virtually
nationalisation by the back door, something unthinkable only a few years ago.
And today I am concerned, not out of any loyalty to Lloyds, but because, like
many other people, I have little faith in Gordon Brown’s determination to throw
vast sums at the banks, on condition they lend billions over the next two years
to their customers. I thought that is what caused the collapse of the banking
system in the first place.
I realise the importance, in the short term, of underwriting the many businesses, farms included, that are suffering cash flow problems. But surely the
quickest way to get the economy moving again is to spend this huge amount
of newly printed money to improve the nations infrastructure, something that
will have to be done eventually.
548

Mar 18th

Anomalies of Organic Culture

The present situation has parallels with what occurred in farming following
the war, which had so nearly bankrupted the nation that we couldn’t afford
to import enough to eat. The drive to increase home food production, with
guaranteed farm prices, might well have failed if the agriculture minister at the
time, our own Tiverton MP, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, hadn’t realised that the
nation’s farm buildings were quite unfit for the task. He introduced the Farm
Buildings Grant scheme, which provided one third of the capital needed to erect
buildings to bring us into the 20th century.
In our case, there isn’t a single building currently in use for farming that
was built before the late 1950s. The capital grants scheme, as well as keeping
our borrowing to an affordable level (just), had the additional advantage of
allowing strict control over the quality of the buildings we were putting up. I
can well remember the look of horror on our local builders face, as the ministry
inspector made holes with a crowbar in some newly laid concrete to see if it was
the regulation thickness all over.
Without that scheme, I doubt that many of the small to medium sized farms
would ever have modernized, or be in existence today. Our larger neighbours
would certainly have swallowed us up by now.
Given a free hand, I know where I would spend most of the new money the
Prime Minister is chucking at the present crisis: bring our railways into the 21st
century. We are all going to continue to travel and transport goods. Without
using oil, and until an alternative fuel is developed, green electricity is the key.
And as I see it, that means a modernised railway system. Even without a crisis,
I would far rather travel in a high-speed train than wait around for hours in
an airport or sit watching the taillights of the car in front on a snarled up
motorway.

Anomalies of Organic Culture
Organic farmers have been having a very hard time in recent months. It has
been suggested that if they are unable to obtain an organic premium, livestock
producers should be allowed to revert temporarily to using non-organic feed,
organic feed being in short supply this year and extremely expensive. Obviously
any animals fed in this way could not be sold as organic, and there would need
to be a suitable time lapse before these farms were fully organic again.
A proposal to this effect was put to DEFRA last month by the dozen or
more organic certifying bodies, so far without response. But I was surprised at
the time that the Soil Association, the largest of these organisations, had gone
549

2009
along with the request. I thought the Soil Association was unwavering in its
belief that farming organically was the only way to ensure a sustainable food
supply in a climate changing world. It also claims to be championing human
health and delivering the highest standards of animal welfare.
Of course, this may just be rhetoric from the high priests of the movement,
but there are certainly many very successful farmers who believe implicitly in
organic principles and wouldn’t dream of deviating from the straight and narrow
simply because times are hard. In fact, I have always assumed these principles
are virtually laid down in tablets of stone. So I am even more surprised now
to read that, following the outcome of a consultation with its licence holding
farmers, of which we are one, the Soil Association has withdrawn its support
for a request to DEFRA for a relaxing of the organic feed standards.
No doubt, seeing the dominance of the organisation in the eyes of the government, this will knock the whole idea on the head. As a result, there may well
be many dairy, pig and poultry producers who, being more vulnerable to feed
costs than beef and sheep farmers, will find the going very tough indeed until
harvest time. And in the event of another difficult summer, some may have to
give up organic production - a few possibly going out of farming altogether.
I now have a bit of a guilty conscience, seeing we made no attempt to put our
view to the consultation. We might have been against relaxing feed standards,
but we could have suggested that the Soil Association persuade DEFRA to
support organic farmers financially through the credit crunch, if that is the
root cause of the decline in demand. The government has, after all, put too
much money into the organic movement to allow it to falter at this first real
hurdle.
Actually, I had no idea that we were likely to have any influence on the Soil
Associations Standards Board. It was reported that there was a huge amount
of interest, but this is hardly borne out by the fact that there were only 158
responses from organic farmers. If that small fraction of the total number of
licensees can produce a complete turn around, perhaps we should make our
opinions known more often. Or perhaps, dare I say it, the foundations on which
the organic movement is based are on softer ground than we are led to believe.
While we obviously have to have a strict set of regulations to satisfy the
public that we really are farming organically, I sometimes wonder if we tend to
over-egg the cake. Avoiding the use of inorganic fertilisers and sprays may be
putting less stress on the environment, but can we be sure we are championing
human health? The less well-off might argue that we are encouraging a two-tier
market, without any positive proof of the health benefits, and in the long-term
the possibility of a reduced food supply.

Vaccinate Cattle for Bovine TB

I have even more difficulty with the claim made by the Soil Association that
it delivers the highest standards of animal welfare. Increasing the space available to livestock housed during the winter or extending the area available for
grazing is not an organic choice – all farmers are responsible for the wellbeing
of their animals. If the national standards are currently inadequate they should
be adjusted. I could go further and suggest that the organic regulations governing veterinary treatment are so strict that preventative medicine is actually
discouraged. I had better leave it at that. We have just passed our annual
inspection, but there is always next year’s to worry about.

March 25th
Vaccinate Cattle for Bovine TB
I e across a surprisingly upbeat prediction about TB in cattle in an old edition
of the Ministry of Agriculture’s monthly journal, dated November 1956 the
other day. It was in an article about the unremitting struggle over the previous
twenty-one years to eradicate TB.
A government committee, set up in 1932 to consider how to improve the
national milk supply when 40 per cent of all cows in the country were infected,
had come to the conclusion that the total eradication of bovine TB was the only
solution to the problem of tuberculous milk. The final stages in that campaign,
introduced in October 1950, at about the time I started farming here in Devon,
involved a voluntary testing scheme for the eradication of the disease on an
area-by-area basis.
Farmers were encouraged to join the scheme with bonus payments on a milk
or headage basis, any TB reactors being slaughtered with compensation. This
had succeeded so well that the report ended with the optimistic forecast that:
“There is every reason to hope that by the early 1960s bovine tuberculosis in
Great Britain will for all practical purposes be a thing of the past”.
The prediction very nearly proved correct. The whole of Britain was attested
by 1960, but reactors continued to appear in parts of the southwest. When
infected badgers were discovered in these areas, the possibility of a wildlife
reservoir of infection was looked into. From 1971 to 1978, 5700 wild mammals
were taken for laboratory examination and bovine TB was found in three foxes,
five rats, two moles and 513 badgers. It was also demonstrated at the time that
the infection could be passed from badger to badger and from badger to cattle.
From 1975, on farms where reactors repeatedly recurred, the disease was only
brought under control by the gassing of setts found to be occupied by infected
badgers. By the end of that decade, we had once again almost made bovine TB
551

2009
a thing of the past. But a combination of factors - the badger protection acts,
the lack of a humane way of killing diseased badgers in infected setts to replace
the unacceptable use of cyanide gas, and growing public concern for culling
badgers for whatever reason, has now put us right back to where we were in
1950, when the number of reactors slaughtered each year was proportionately
far less than the number of cows we are slaughtering today.
By foolishly allowing the TB bacillus to build up in the wildlife reservoir
during the last 25 years, we are very nearly past the point of no return. The
announcement by the DEFRA Secretary, Hilary Benn, last week that a badger
vaccine will be deployed next year on an experimental basis for five years in six
small hotspot areas is tantamount to conceding that he has given up completely.
He admits that an injectable vaccine will never be practical for widespread use
by farmers in the field.
I don’t doubt that ways will be found to jab badgers in the rump through
the bars of a trap with specially adapted hypodermic guns, without the need
to actually handle the animals. But the perturbation effect which conveniently
killed off any possibility of the recent culling trials succeeding, will be as nothing
to the speed with which badgers will hightail it out of their home territories
during the five years of repeat vaccinations. Since in these hotspots, many of
the badgers will already be infected, and will, as Mr Benn admits, benefit in no
way from the vaccine, the disease will continue to be scattered far and wide.
Just as eradicating TB was erroneously thought to be the only answer to the
problem of tuberculous milk in 1932 (pasteurisation eventually solved that one),
so attempting to vaccinate badgers now is too late and too costly in slaughtered
cattle and disillusioned farmers. Why did DEFRA take 11 years spending £23
million in vaccine research, before resorting to the BCG vaccine that is widely
used in humans and is available in vast quantities from Sweden? And why,
if that vaccine works for badgers, aren’t we already starting a programme of
cattle vaccination, and getting the rules about the use of vaccines changed in
Brussels? Because that is undoubtedly where we shall eventually end up, with
TB testing and the slaughtering of reactors a thing of the past. I hope I am
around to see it.

Aiming to Boost Bird Numbers

April 1st
Aiming to Boost Bird Numbers
It may be my imagination, but we seem to have fewer garden birds around this
spring. I remarked on it at the end of February, and assumed it was due to the
cold snowy weather at the time, but here we are in April and nothing much has
changed. We have our usual resident robins, wrens and blackbirds, but not the
invasion of finches that we had last year and only the occasional song thrush,
tit or warbler.
The grass is starting to grow, the cows and calves have been turned out and
the lambs are doing nicely on the red clover leys, so hopefully the missing garden
birds will soon appear. But had I been doing a bird count during a specific week
recently as an environmental indicator, I might have jumped to the conclusion
that we had committed some dreadful act of agricultural vandalism during the
last twelve months.
Since we haven’t changed the way we farm – we are still organic, which is
claimed to be a benign way of managing the environment, and are sandwiched
between large organic farms on either side of us - any fluctuation in bird numbers
is unlikely to be of our doing. If the population of smaller nesting birds is
unusually low this coming summer, I suppose we might seek advice from the
RSPB or the Devon Wildlife Trust, to see if there is anything we can do to help
boost bird numbers. But that would be entirely at our own discretion.
So far as I am aware, farmers are under no legal obligation to manage the
land for the benefit of farmland birds. We can apply to receive the Single Farm
Payment, which does involve complying with a number of environmental conditions, but there is no compulsion to do so. In practice, it is almost impossible
to make a living without taking the Single Farm Payment.
Unfortunately DEFRA Secretary, Hilary Benn, has been persuaded that a
small number of certain farmland bird species can act as an indicator of the
overall state of the national environment. He has also been persuaded that the
only way to maintain the populations of these 19 species is to take about five per
cent of England’s cultivated land out of production, and use it for environmental
purposes. To achieve this, Benn intends to use the threat of deductions from
our Single Farm Payments as a stick to beat us with.
Farming leaders are so alarmed at the loss of these arable acres, depriving
the nation of a considerable quantity of homegrown food, that they have come
up with a softer option using Environmental Stewardship, which they are pressuring the government to accept. Personally, if it were anything to do with me,
I’d leave well alone. If politicians want to regulate farming and the environment
553

2009
by counting birds, when there are plenty of other reasons for a decline in numbers, let them take the responsibility of explaining the logic of it to the nation,
and end up with the egg on their own faces.
The difficulty with any blanket approach to maintaining populations of farmland wildlife is the fact that every farm is, to some extent, different. Many years
ago, we were lucky enough to have a friend, the chairman of our local branch
of the Devon Wildlife Trust, who enjoyed walking the farm on a regular basis.
Like most farmers, we thought we knew what wildlife we had around us, but
we were simply too busy to study our own acres properly.
Ken, over a cup of coffee, would tell us in detail what he had seen on each
occasion, and better still, what we could do, or avoid doing, to encourage the
various species to prosper. He helped us draw up a list of what we had on the
farm – 16 species of mammal, 27 butterfly species and a surprising 56 different
birds nesting on the farm at one time or another.
Looking at that list today, I see that we had eleven of the nineteen indicator
birds that the RSPB is so concerned about. How much their numbers have
varied over the years, only Ken would be able to tell us. Sadly, he is no longer
with us, but I reckon he had more influence on the wildlife here than all the
government environmental and stewardship schemes that we are involved in
today. Perhaps there is the germ of an idea there for the future.

April 8th
New Rules Will Lack the Time
The government has finally unveiled its plans to make livestock farmers take on
some of the responsibility and cost of controlling exotic diseases. The idea has
been on the cards for some time and I am only surprised that DEFRA has left
it so long to get out from under the shambles it has made for itself. As Arthur
Street put it so succinctly in an article for the Farmers Weekly in 1940: “As
we now know only too well, while a politician can hopelessly jigger up farming,
only farmers can put it right”. Nothing changes.
The proposals are contained in a consultation to which we are invited to
reply by the end of June. The document is the usual lengthy screed so beloved
of senior DEFRA officials, which had me falling asleep before reaching the end
- presumably the intention. I get the impression that the matter is already cut
and dried and the consultation is merely a way of hoodwinking the public into
believing farmers are fully involved in deciding how the government is going to
tax us to raise the extra money needed.
554

Apr 8th

New Rules Will Lack the Time

Farming leaders are already up in arms about talk of on-farm insurance
against diseases like ‘foot and mouth’ and bovine TB. Insurance companies
have made it quite clear they are not prepared to get involved in such risky and
uncertain business. And the Treasury has objected to the idea of a levy on farm
animals as contravening the rules on taxation, in that it is building up a fund
for an uncertain contingency. No doubt DEFRA will come up with another
super wheeze for getting the cash out of us, although I shall be interested to
know how any levy surplus to requirements will eventually be repaid.
Actually it is not the money that bothers me most. The various diseases
that have afflicted livestock in recent years have cost farmers so dearly that I
think most of us would be happy to pay a levy if we really were allowed to
take some responsibility for controlling them. Unfortunately, the body that
DEFRA Secretary Hilary Benn is intending to set up appears to give farmers
no part in the decision-making process whatsoever. All the consultation asks
us to decide is whether we want a quango, answerable through a Secretary of
State to parliament, or a non-departmental public body, answerable through
DEFRA.
Although I probably prefer a quango, which does appear to be further from
the reach of the dead hand of DEFRA, in practice it will make little difference.
Benn has already made up his mind that he will be ultimately responsible
for the new body. This will consist of a board of eight to ten non-executive
directors of his choosing, serving on a part-time basis, half of them having some
knowledge or experience of the livestock industry. To suggest that this is a
proper consultation is a complete farce.
If livestock farmers are going to fund half the cost of disease control, we
must be allowed to appoint or, better still, vote-on at least half the directors.
How else can it be said that we are engaged in the decision-making process, as
Benn so glibly affirms? Any new statutory body can only operate successfully
if it is completely independent, even to the extent of distancing itself from any
interference by a Government minister and answerable directly to Parliament.
This Government will be going to the polls in the next twelve months. Whatever is decided now will not be on the statute book before 2012, so I doubt if
Hilary Benn is very bothered about the outcome of any consultation. Whichever
party is in power by then will have too much on its plate with the repercussions
of the recession to worry about the workings of an agricultural quango set up
before it took office. So this is really our only opportunity of getting something
capable of taking proper control of the animal-disease nightmare agreed with
government.
555

2009
Farmers have set up and managed agricultural boards successfully in the
past – take the marketing boards as an example – and I believe we should be
aiming along these lines now. The public would be delighted to be shot of the
whole sorry mess and we would at last have some hope of a future for livestock
farming.

April 15th
Families Still Run Our Farms
Hardly a week goes by without some eminent individual or well-known organization deploring the loss of family farms. This time, it was the turn of Tom
Oliver, head of rural policy at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, speaking at a debate organised by the Family Farm Association. He is concerned
that the survival of family farms is threatened, and he urges family farmers to
find their voice in British and European politics.
I have to assume Mr Oliver is talking about small farms rather than family
farms. Off hand, I can’t think of any farm of whatever size in our immediate
neighbourhood that isn’t owned, rented, or managed by a family, or family
partnership. The Westcountry is comprised mainly of family farms. Even in of
the eastern counties of England, the large arable farms are often run as family
businesses. I don’t suppose I am very wide of the mark if I said that we are a
nation of family farms.
So what exactly is the CPRE seeking to protect? How small do farms have
to be to be considered the traditional lifeblood of the British countryside, and
why do they bring a great deal of public benefit, as Mr Oliver is reported to have
suggested in the debate? Surely, these assumptions are based on very dubious
grounds, and liable to give a largely urban public a completely false impression
of farming.
If by definition, a small farm is one that is barely large enough to produce a
living for a farmer and his family, there have always been small farms. Before
the enclosures, the term might have been used to describe an acre, two cows and
a strip of land in the village open-field. One hundred years ago, 25 to 30 acres
might have been sufficient for a family’s survival. And until quite recently, I
reckon about 100 acres, depending on the quality of the land, would have been
the absolute minimum without some form of specialisation or an outside job.
But, through the ages, making ends meet must always have depended on the
ability of the farmer and how much he could produce from his land, hardly a
public benefit unless the nation was short of food.
556

New Life for an Old Plough

Since the Second World War, agricultural support has been based on production, which undoubtedly favoured the larger farm with its economies of scale.
Today, with the introduction of the Single Farm Payment Scheme, the situation has changed somewhat. Presumably for the sake of simplicity, payments
under this scheme take no account of the quality of the land, but are made at a
flat acreage rate. This does result in even greater discrimination between farm
businesses.
Taking our own case as an example, we are farming about 300 acres of hilly,
in places difficult land, producing extensive organic beef and lamb. Judged
solely on turnover, I could argue that ours is a small farm. A 75-acre farm, one
quarter the size of ours, on good Devon Redland should, if farmed intensively,
be capable of producing a similar quantity of beef and lamb, but would only be
entitled to a quarter of our Single Farm Payment.
Is this apparent inequality what the CPRE is crusading about? Should we
be receiving a lot less and the 75- acre farm a lot more, and if so, what benefit
would taxpayers get for their money? We are, after all, managing a larger
area of land to strictly enforced environmental standards. The smaller farm is
possibly providing a new entrant with a first step on the farming ladder, but
environmental payments will be the last thing on his mind.
I confess I have no answer to a problem that has been with us since farming
began. The next three years may well see all direct support payments phased
out completely, with any farm grants being made only for specific environmental
work. That will make it more difficult for the smaller farm to generate enough
income to make a living. And, who knows, within twenty years worldwide
food shortages may make the public’s attitude to farming change even more
dramatically. Producing enough food would become the first priority, with the
environment coming a poor second. And in a strange way, smaller farms might
then finally come into their own, since I believe they are capable of producing
more food per acre when the going gets really tough.

April 22nd
New Life for an Old Plough
I have just given away my old Ransome’s plough, at one time probably the
most valuable farm implement I possessed. Actually my son gave it away after
hauling it out of the bushes, where it had been quietly rusting into a heap
of agricultural junk. Another year or two and it would have been completely
hidden from any DEFRA ‘spy in the sky’ under a canopy of brambles, but Jim
has been complying recently with the waste regulations that we are saddled with
557

2009
these days, which demand the removal of discarded and broken farm machinery
to an official scrap yard or risk forfeiting some of our Single Farm Payment.
Having loaded the plough onto a trailer, Jim decided that although it hadn’t
been used for about 15 years, there was still some life left in it. So instead of
scrapping it, he gave it to a friend, a timber-framer he supplies with wood from
time to time, who has recently taken on about 35 acres of land on which to
start farming.
The plough will need renovating, but I am glad to think it will see more
action before ending up in the corner of some Devon field, hopefully after these
stupid waste regulations have been scrapped in their turn. It will be a great
shame if farms become so tidy that there is no evidence of the implements we
have used in our time to be found by the farmers who come after us.
I have turned up a variety of ancient implements over the years - old toothless
drag harrows blocking-up holes in hedges being the most common, but on one
occasion a horse-drawn potato ridging plough which I attempted rather unsuccessfully to use behind a tractor and, more recently, an old two-row horse-hoe,
parts of which now do duty as iron gate posts for the garden gate.
The Ransome’s plough was bought second-hand donkeys-years ago from a
local machinery dealer – exactly when I don’t recall, but it must have been in
the 1960s. It was our first decent plough, replacing a less suitable one that was
not really up to the job on some of our steeper ground. It was a four-furrow,
one-way plough, somewhat the worse for wear, which set me back the princely
sum of £270 according to a later 1984 set of farm accounts, by which time it had
been depreciated to a value of £31. Over the years, that old plough, repaired
now and then by our local blacksmiths, must have turned over every field on
the farm, the level ones and the impossibly steep ones, many on numerous
occasions.
In those days, even on smaller farms, it was essential to have your own
plough if you intended to grow corn and root crops for feeding to livestock.
Agricultural contractors were always available for some of the harvesting jobs,
but not for ploughing as I remember. We continued to do our own ploughing for
a while after we gave up the dairy herd 20 years ago, but found it easier, after
we had stopped growing kale and maize, to use contractors who were equipping
themselves with larger and more up to date tackle, something we could ill afford
for the few acres of corn we needed for our suckler herd.
But times seem to be changing once again. Since going organic, and reverting
to short-term grass leys to produce enough winter feed, Jim has found relying
on contractors to arrive exactly when needed is becoming a headache. Without
the backup of fertilisers or sprays to correct difficult conditions, timeliness is
558

May 6th

New PC to Defeat Crime Wave

increasingly important, as it always used to be. Not only that, farms with
smaller fields like ours in this part of North Devon, are becoming less and less
suitable for the enormous tractors and machinery now used by contractors. In
some instances we are finding they cannot even get down our lane, let alone
turn sharply into a gateway, as we discovered last autumn trying to locate a
combine to cut our corn.
Jim has therefore been updating some of our machinery to dispense with
contractors as far as possible, using the organic-conversion grants we have received in the last three years. Probably the most important item is a decent
modern second-hand reversible plough, with which he completed our spring
ploughing at just the right soil conditions to get our spring-sown oats off to a
good start.
Hopefully, my old Ransome’s plough will do the same for the farming career
of Ben, our timber-framing friend.

May 6th
New PC to Defeat Crime Wave
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later. Preparing to email my weekly
contribution to the WMN early last Tuesday morning,I turned on my computer,
only to find it had crashed or, rather, was refusing to boot up properly. A panic
phone call to Paul Grant, my local computer consultant, confirmed my worst
fears - the wretched machine was a write-off and would have to be replaced. It
was hardly six years old, but even computers wear out apparently, although the
information in them lasts almost for ever.
Fortunately Paul was able to advise me on buying a new computer through
the internet which was delivered within 24 hours, and into which he installed
the necessary programmes and recovered all my files. Two days later I was back
at the keyboard, much relieved, if somewhat the poorer.
Paul left me with a slightly better understanding of how a computer works
and the guts of the old computer to use as a paper weight – a heavy lump of
metal about the size of my desktop calculator and containing six-years paperwork and hundreds of photos.
I asked Paul how he saw himself in today’s rural scene and he rather modestly
suggested that perhaps he was a kind of modern village blacksmith. I can’t
really visualise him shoeing a carthorse under the spreading chestnut tree, but
it’s not a bad analogy considering how vital a computer is becoming in running
a farm.
559

2009
However, something that seems to be fast disappearing is adequate rural
policing. This was the subject of my ill-fated piece last week. According to the
local constabulary, I must have started farming in some bygone era, following my
suggestion that we were better protected in the past by the presence of a village
policeman. I was attending the launch of a new police-initiative appointing a
‘Rural Engagement Officer’ for the Crediton area.
I had asked if this was intended to be the modern equivalent of a bobby on
a bicycle patrolling our country lanes at at any hour of the day or night, but I
was assured that there was no possibility of going back to anything approaching
those ‘good old days’. It is not an extension of the ‘farm watch scheme’, nor is
it a in any way a new form of rural policing. It is an attempt to forge closer
links with farmers in the surrounding countryside on a purely advisory basis.
We had some pretty good village policemen in the 50s and 60s. Everyone
knew them by name, knew where they lived and how to get hold of them in an
emergency. They, in their turn knew everybody on their patch, and kept their
eyes open for suspicious strangers. The obvious downside was the number of
petty offences that ended up in the local magistrate’s court.
I certainly did my share of getting done for minor misdemeanours. I was
caught by my first village copper failing to stop at the halt sign by the pub –
a dodgy clutch often stalling my 1930s Austin 7 from a stationery start. His
successor did me for an unsafe load, an empty churn falling from my trailer as
I sped through the deserted village at five mph, the top speed for tractors in
those days. And a third brush with the law was caused by our very intelligent
sheepdog following his habit of checking the neighbouring parishes after dark
to see if he could pass on his valuable genes. Unfortunately he always ended
up in the early hours waiting outside a distant police house, knowing I would
be informed by telephone and obliged to fetch him home. Eventually police
patience wore thin and I was up before the beak for a thirty bob fine.
In view of the current spate of cattle and sheep rustling and the increase
in thefts from farm premises reported in the press, any police initiative is to
be welcomed. Whether the presence of the new Rural Engagement Officer, in
the shape of Special Constable Bob Webb, will actually make much difference
to the rural crime figures, I have my doubts. But if he can begin by getting a
quick response to calls for police assistance, something that most farmers feel
is sadly lacking at present, he will get our full support.

Time for Beckett to Apologise

May 13th
Time for Beckett to Apologise
It looks as if some of DEFRA’s chickens are at last coming home to roost. I
am referring to the recent admission by DEFRA that in its present form, the
Single Farm Payment Scheme is proving too costly to administer. It has therefore decided to eliminate as many of the smaller claims as possible and has
just launched a consultation paper about removing the so-called ’pony paddocks’ from the scheme altogether. When the scheme was originally introduced
four years ago, the arrogant and self-opinionated Margaret Beckett decided she
would operate it in England in a different way to every other country across
Europe, including Scotland and Wales.
I suppose as the first Secretary of State for DEFRA, the new ministry which
had replaced MAFF in 2002, she thought she could do it better. She sought
the views of the farming industry about how the scheme should work, and then
totally ignored them, and against the advice, I believe, of her own officials, she
pressed on with a bastardised scheme that was fraught with difficulties. Leaving
aside the complications that arose from having a different and varying payment
rate per acre for every working farmer, Beckett included the owners of plots of
land as small as three quarters of an acre, not much more than a large garden,
as being entitled to claim a single farm payment.
This resulted in a huge number of new applicants, most of whom were not
farmers at all, having to be added to DEFRA’s records. Inevitably in the first
year of the scheme, DEFRA was overwhelmed. It’s existing staff and computers
couldn’t handle the extra work, the new computers brought in to compensate
were found to be incompatible with the old ones, accurately mapping these extra
acres caused delays followed by more delays. Eventually many farmers were left
unpaid months after the official date laid down by Brussels for settlement.
In due course, this sorry tale of mismanagement of EU farm subsidies was
penalised by the EU with fines of up to £500 million imposed on the British
Government. With MPs, from the Prime Minister down, currently falling over
themselves apologising for the mishandling of their expense accounts, I am
surprised that Margaret Beckett hasn’t taken the opportunity to apologise for
her performance while at DEFRA. With the media in such a ferment reporting
political shenanigans, the monumental loss to the tax payer for which she was
responsible is surely something worth being sorry about and might make the
expense account apologies look pathetic by comparison.
It is quite possible that she may yet find herself dragged into the public
eye. DEFRA recently admitted that it costs nearly £750 to process and pay
561

2009
each ’pony paddock’ claimant. As their Single Farm Payment often amounts to
less than half this amount, with many claims below £50, and in a few cases as
little as £5, this is obviously a ridiculous waste of public money. For such small
claims, a clipboard-clutching DEFRA inspector could visit the claimant, do the
paperwork on the back of an envelope and hand over the cash for a fraction of
the cost.
As for the current DEFRA consultation asking for the industry’s opinion
on what the minimum size of holding should be, and whether claimants should
demonstrate that they are in the business of farming, the three main farmer
organisations are at odds with each other. The Country Landowners Association
is against any minimum threshold or the imposition of a farmer qualification
- it might hit membership numbers. The Tenants Farmers Association is not
unnaturally in favour of raising it to over twelve acres and the removal of nonfarmers. And the NFU seems to be vacillating between the two.
Personally, I don’t actually think its any of our business. DEFRA is entirely
responsible for this shambles – it is not our job to sort it out. Anyway, when
have the politicians ever taken any notice of our views?

May 20th
Woes of Organic Farming
Perhaps I am just getting old or maybe it’s my imagination, but, farming wise,
we seem to have had one of the most depressing springs that I can recall. Cold
and snowy to begin the year, followed by short spells of extremely wet or very
dry weather, with no settled spells at all, and temperatures well below average.
Grass growth has been dismally slow to get going, and the cattle needed to be
turned out progressively as our reserves of winter fodder dwindled.
But at last May has come to her senses and delivered a timely and commendable amount of rain. Our spring oats, which seemed to have stopped
growing and were barely covering the ground, have responded immediately and
we should now get some worthwhile cuts of hay and silage. That is provided
the weather warms up from here on.
I realise my present feelings are coloured by the fact that farming organically
is more at the mercy of the weather. There is plenty of grass on farms in the
neighbourhood, with some silage already cleared from the fields, and winter
corn looking well. But I assume these have all been helped by an early dressing
of nitrogen fertilizer which is readily absorbed, unlike the farm yard manure,
however well composted, which Jim spread on much of our grass ground during
the drier days in March.

Woes of Organic Farming

Organic beef prices have recovered a little since last November, when a bunch
of fat bullocks we sent off made little more than non-organic beef. A year ago,
the organic premium was a healthy thirty per cent; now it is around the ten per
cent mark, and with the premium on fat lamb rarely more than five per cent,
organic farming is hardly profitable. In fact, without the extra support from
the farm environmental schemes, it certainly wouldn’t be.
Admittedly, there are some advantages. We are unlikely to be troubled
by any new set-aside regulations if they are reintroduced in an attempt to
boost farmland bird numbers. And the nitrogen limits, which have now been
imposed on this area of North Devon (a new Nitrate Vulnerable Zone), are so
far above our actual application of organic nitrogen, that we can comfortably
ignore them. Cutting input costs is really the only way of remaining profitable
while the public are so reluctant to pay a reasonable premium.
And that is easier said than done. Our input costs are at an absolute
minimum already. We buy no animal feed, which was horrendously expensive
last winter. All we purchase are minerals for the livestock, and a load or two
of straw each year that, for some unknown reason, does not as yet have to
be organic. Lime and organic phosphate, when needed, and tractor diesel and
contractors charges are no higher than for other farms.
However one area where we heavily penalised is the cost of seed. Organic
seed corn can be anything up to a couple of hundred pounds a ton dearer than
non-organic. And the price of grass seeds, the purchase of which is unavoidable
with short term leys so much a part of organic husbandry, is sometimes two
or three times more than for conventional seed. I have always wondered about
the logic of this, and was therefore very interested in the forward to this year’s
’Cotswold Grass Seeds’ organic catalogue.
Ian Wilkinson, the Managing Director, writes that he is extremely concerned
about the high cost and poor availability of organically grown grass seeds. He
makes the point that genetically there is no advantage to the consumers of organic food. The DNA in seed is totally stable, and is the basis of the resulting
plant. Unnecessary over- regulation is resulting in higher food prices and the
possibility of losing the very core of organic farming, the organic farmers themselves. Coming from someone in Mr Wilkinson’s position, very strong words
indeed.

Jack’s Day Out at the Show
What a glorious three days we had for the Devon County Show this year. In the
past, the show seems to have suffered too often from a spell of unsettled weather.
This has been welcomed by us, since we are usually in need of some hefty
showers in mid-May to ensure that, however hot or dry the coming summer,
the pastures will survive without turning to dust as they did in 1976. I have
therefore always been quite happy to tour the show in a macintosh or clutching
an umbrella, which is rather a selfish attitude on my part, considering how much
the organisers do to make it a success.
For some reason best known to the show committee, this year’s show was
held a week later than usual. - I believe it is something to do with the date on
which the third Thursday in May falls. As a result, we have had the best of
both worlds for a change. A very wet week in mid-May, the week in which the
show usually takes place, followed by the finest show weather I can remember.
You may have noticed that I am starting this piece on an unusually cheerful
and upbeat note. Last week I began by bemoaning what I thought was one of
the most depressing springs I could recall. I make no apologies, but the flak I
received over it from family and friends, who totally disagreed with me, fairly
set me back on my heels.
It has been a wonderful spring, they all said – look at the fantastic show of
flowers in all the hedgerows and gardens this year. In fact my daughter, Cath,
who I can rely on to make a fair comment about my weekly jottings, admitted
that she very nearly stopped reading after the first paragraph. Of course, like
most of the other critics, she is a keen gardener and I have to agree that the
spring flowers have been rather special. But you can’t eat flowers and as a
farmer, I was writing about the lack of early grass for the cattle.
To get back to the Devon County Show, we went on the Friday and had a
thoroughly enjoyable day. My brother-in-law, Jack, is an inveterate show goer.
I reckon he must have started going to the County Show in its roving days in
the 1930s when it was held at a different market town each year. If it was
within reach of a bicycle I have no doubt Jack would have made an effort to get
there. After the war, when the show restarted and the family had a car, the
lure of the tractor and machinery lines, Jack’s particular interest, must have
been irresistible, with the purchase of a new tractor or implement needed for
the farm generally taking place there.
When the show settled down on a permanent site at Whipton in Exeter in
1956, we went most years. I have to confess that, for all the traffic jams, the
564

What’s the Value of Four Swarms of Honey Bees

over-crowded conditions, the occasional mud baths that passed for car parks,
I enjoyed it more than I have since the show moved to Westpoint. But for
Jack, particularly recently, going to the show has not been a case of ’if’, but
’which’ day. He is now in his ninetieth year and having great difficulty getting
about, but enjoys it so much that my son, Jim, decided to push him around in
a wheelchair.
I am glad we went. The sun shone, the avenues were crowded, and the
smell of good Devonshire food hit us as soon as we came through the gates.
We stayed much longer than we had intended and Jack had the unexpected
bonus of witnessing two of his cousins taking part in the events in the main
arena – one driving his carefully restored Fordson Major in the vintage tractor
procession, and the other receiving a long service award from the Devon County
Agricultural Association.
I believe the attendance figures were a record, and that visitors were turned
away on the Saturday. That’s the kind of news that bodes well for the future,
but I very much hope the timing of the show remains where it was this year,
one week before the Bath and West.

June 3rd
What’s the Value of Four Swarms of Honey Bees
If, as the old saying goes, a swarm of bees in May is worth a load of hay, what
are four swarms of bees all on the same day worth – a kings ransom? In view of
the gloomy forecasts about the future of our honey bees, it seemed worthwhile
recording such an unusual occurrence that happened here about ten days ago,
all four swarms settling within fifty yards of each other.
The strongest swarm was massed on the end wall of the farmhouse and
seemed interested in a crack in the stonework leading to a space behind a window
lintel. There were so many bees about that Jim investigated the small coppice
behind the farmhouse where there are some empty hives from his beekeeping
days. Sure enough, another swarm was settling in, although the hive was not
really in a condition to receive them. A third swarm was in a tree close by and
the fourth, which Jim initially assumed to be part of the first, was making a
home for itself behind the lintel of another window in the farmhouse.
I hadn’t seen a bee (plenty of bumble bees but no honey bees) anywhere on
the farm this spring until this extraordinary and very welcome invasion took
place. Jim found a home for two of the swarms and he will be keeping the other
two. Where these bees came from is a mystery, with the weather at the time
not particularly overcast or thundery – the normal swarming conditions. I am
565

2009
not aware that any of our neighbouring farms are keeping bees at present and
our last wild colony has finally disappeared from its hollow tree, which it had
been occupying for as long as I can remember.
For this to happen when all the talk is of bee numbers plummeting goes
to show that the presence of wildlife, or in this case semi-wild life, is quite
unpredictable. The RSPB has recently announced that bird numbers are still
declining at an alarming rate, with more than a fifth of our bird species now on
the endangered list, five per cent more than seven years ago. There are even
fears that the sound of the cuckoo may soon disappear from our countryside,
but there are still plenty of cuckoos in France, and we have no real idea what
climate change will do to bird migration.
For example, this year the swallows returned at their usual time, but housemartins which are normally back before the middle of May, were worryingly
absent. They have now very recently arrived, but perhaps they are more sensitive than swallows to insect numbers.
I did attribute the disappearance of our long -term resident wrens and pied
wagtails to the shortage of flies in the spring, but I have changed my mind. Both
species were around well into March, when we were suddenly visited regularly by
a marauding sparrow hawk. These killers of small farmland birds have learned
that country houses are the best source of an easy lunch, displayed for their
convenience on a bird table or hanging from a nut dispenser. Jim actually had
a sparrow hawk fly at full speed through their open back door, turn sharp right
in the back hall into their kitchen and out through an open window. Had the
window been shut, who knows what mayhem it might have caused among the
crockery.
I don’t believe we should be feeding birds except in exceptional weather
– I suspect it encourages the wrong species to gain dominance, and weakens
the natural hardiness of all the species that frequent these feeding stations.
Unfortunately we have neighbours, living in farmhouses in our lane but not
themselves farmers, who seem to think they are doing the right thing by the
birds if they keep the bird food coming in excessive quantities throughout the
year. And the RSPB promotes this by advertising the sale of bird food on their
website at discount prices with the profit promised for conservation.
Why the RSPB is demanding a return to the compulsory set-aside of arable
land, when seven years of this restriction on farming has made little if any difference to the decline in farmland bird numbers, I fail to see. It has rejected
the recent proposal by the NFU and CLA that a voluntary approach encouraging farmers to take up environmental stewardship schemes is the best way to
replace set-aside, and instead wants farmers penalised through deductions from

their single farm payments. The RSPB surely realises that, with farmers, the
carrot has far more influence than the stick.

June 10th
Sadness at Minister’s Departure
It is unusual for an agriculture minister to leave office with farmers actually expressing regret at his or her departure. With all the turmoil currently swirling
around the corridors of power, it looked for a while as if we had escaped the
resignations and sackings that have been hitting the headlines over the weekend. Until, that is, the Food and Farming Minister, Jane Kennedy, suddenly
announced that she could no longer support Gordon Brown as Prime Minister,
following which she was,not unnaturally, immediately replaced.
I think Hilary Benn’s name was mentioned early on as a possible candidate
in a cabinet reshuffle, but much to our disappointment, he seems to have been
overlooked and will presumably continue as Secretary of State at DEFRA for
the remainder of this Parliament. But the loss of his deputy, Jane Kennedy,
is a big blow to the industry. She had only been in the job for a few months
and was making a very positive impression by her willingness to get her boots
muddy and see what actually goes on down on the farm. Her departure has
been greeted with dismay by farming leaders from all sides of the industry.
Whether there is any significance in the fact that Gordon Brown has replaced her with a Glaswegian who, before becoming an MP, was for 23 years a
professional firefighter with the London Fire Brigade, remains to be seen. Jim
Fitzpatrick may be adept at tackling emergencies after the event, but, from his
urban background, it looks as if he is very unlikely to have much experience of
farming and the countryside. Not that this is essential in a newly-appointed
minister, so long as he is willing to do as Ms. Kennedy was doing – finding out
at first hand what food production is all about. And, unfortunately, time is not
on his side, with less than a year to go before a General Election.
The one small bonus in all this is the final removal of Margaret Beckett from
her seat at the cabinet table. She never did attempt to get her shoes dirty, except
possibly when unhitching the family caravan in a wet summer. During her time
as DEFRA Secretary, she certainly appeared to have very little sympathy for
farmers struggling with the cock-up she had made of the Single Farm Payments
Scheme, treating us for the most part as a bunch of yokels it was her misfortune
to be in charge of. It has worried me for some time now that her opinion in
recent years may have been sought by the Prime Minister, on the rare occasions
567

2009
when the problems of the agricultural industry have been under discussion at a
Cabinet Meeting.
That raises the further point about Gordon Brown’s ability to appoint a
minister in charge of farming and rural affairs specifically for England. He has
no responsibility, after all, for such appointments in the other regions of the
UK. In fact, his own constituency, decisions governing agriculture are made by
a minister over whom he has no control whatever.
The possibility of England having some form of devolved government has
never bothered me in the past, but it is becoming apparent that for farmers,
democracy can be singularly absent. It is theoretically possible, for instance,
that a farmer with land straddling the Welsh border at Hay-on-Wye may soon
be allowed to take action against badgers on the Welsh part of his holding to
control an outbreak of Bovine TB, the permission for which has been given
by someone he has had a hand in electing. Here in the South West region
of England, an area greater than Wales, and with a higher concentration of
livestock farming, we have relatively little say in who is appointed over us,
farmers everywhere in the UK having as much say in the matter as we have.
Not that I am suggesting there is much we can do about it, but it is extremely
irksome when we are saddled with a duff minister, as we are at present. However,
judging by events at Westminster, this administration is now on the way out,
and by this time next year, we shall be governed by ministers of a very different
colour. Let’s hope that they do not renege on the promises they are currently
making so freely when they eventually take office.

Are Grey Squirrels Villains?
It is just possible that the grey squirrel may achieve a welcome change in the
public’s understanding of wildlife management in Britain, something the badger
has signally failed to do. In the last 60 years, we seem to have become besotted
with the notion that every species of wild animal that exists in this small and
overcrowded island has got to be preserved whatever the cost, with complete
freedom to breed like rats or rabbits, the only two species whose numbers we
are legally obliged to control.
We even go so far as to clap the equivalent of a preservation order on any
animals we consider to be in terminal decline, going to extraordinary lengths to
reintroduce them from continental Europe where necessary. We have become
an overwhelmingly urban society that sees the countryside as some glorified
unfettered wildlife park, within which farming and food production must tread
568

Jun 17th

Are Grey Squirrels Villains?

with the utmost care to avoid trampling on any of God’s creatures, great or
small.
I am exaggerating somewhat, but we seem to be overlooking the fact that
there just isn’t room for all of us today. If we are to preserve the maximum
diversity of wildlife, and continue to produce a reasonable proportion of our
own food requirements, we shall have to carefully regulate the populations of
all the species that share our countryside, especially the larger mammals and
birds.
Now, suddenly, we are going to the other extreme and being encouraged, not
just to regulate, but to totally exterminate a species of mammal that is probably
as well known and well liked as any in town or countryside – the grey squirrel.
What has this wretched animal done to merit such opprobrium? Even Prince
Charles is apparently prepared to dispatch any grey that dares show its face as
he communes with the trees on his estate. And therein lies the unpardonable
crime of which it is accused – the grey squirrel ring barks and effectively kills
young trees, especially oaks, our national emblem.
It is also accused,among other things, of hastening the extinction of the
red squirrel in much of England by carrying a viral disease to which it is itself
immune. As a comparative newcomer to our countryside, having only been
resident here for the last 140 years, the grey squirrel is being made the scapegoat.
However, its acrobatic antics on urban clothes lines as it attempts to reach
heavily laden bird tables, will probably result in the immediate setting up of
grey squirrel protection societies in a last-ditch attempt to save it.
While I accept that without any natural predators, we have allowed grey
squirrel numbers to get out of control, I don’t believe they are quite the villains
they are made out to be. There were a few red squirrels here on this farm
when I first arrived in 1950. Their presence was almost certainly due to the
Scots Pine woodlands that had been planted 100 years before as farming went
into decline, with most of the trees felled during the First World War. I have
always understood that pine-cones provide an essential part of a red squirrel’s
diet during the winter months, and with Spruce and Douglas Fir replacing Pines
in our plantations, red squirrels numbers inevitably declined. They were long
gone by the time the greys arrived here in the late 1950s, so that the two species
never overlapped.
As for ring-barking young oaks, yes, grey squirrels are undoubtedly guilty.
We have had a small plantation of naturally regenerating oak trees on the farm
stunted in this way, with not a single tree escaping. I am inclined to think
ring-barking may be a stress factor from over-population, which is easily solved
since squirrels are not difficult to control by shooting and trapping. Emotive
569

2009
talk about wholesale extermination is the last thing we need, merely setting the
animal rights brigade against those of us attempting to manage the countryside.
We shall end up precisely where we are relative to badgers and bovine TB.
Society seems to be quite reconciled to the idea of spending £100 million a
year to allow badgers to proliferate completely unchecked, when it is obvious
that sooner or later their numbers will have to be curtailed. I would go so
far as to suggest that the badger protection societies should be held criminally
responsible for the eventual scale of the badger cull which will be needed to
redress the balance of nature.

June 24th
Children Must Stay on Farms
One of the finest and best-equipped farms in this area of Mid Devon has recently
been put on the market, and although land prices are exceptionally high at
present, I am sure it is worth every penny of the asking price. The farm has
been in the same family for over 60 years, but the reason given in the sale
particulars for selling up is that there is no future generation wishing to farm.
I don’t know the exact circumstances, and anyway it is none of my business,
but time and again one hears of cases where well established farming families
are selling because the next generation is not interested in taking over. I find
it a very sad reflection on the state of the agricultural industry at the present
time when all the signs indicate that farmers in the UK are going to be needed
as never before. World food supplies are shrinking in the face of a rapidly
expanding world population, and yet we are expected to farm in ways that
will help limit greenhouses gases and, at the same time, maintain as diverse an
environment as existed in this country 100 years ago.
It is a huge challenge, and we can ill-afford to lose the expertise that these
farming businesses have accumulated over the years. But it is hardly surprising
when you consider the problems that the younger family members have seen
their parents grappling with for the last 20 years, problems over which they have
had little or no control. The list reads like the tribulations of Job – new animal
diseases such as BSE, bluetongue, and bird flu and the old but shamefully managed diseases of Foot and Mouth and Bovine TB; reams of red tape spewing out
of ministry offices in Westminster and Brussels; domineering and unregulated
supermarket chains; prices for crops and livestock products, fertilizers and fuel
fluctuating wildly from year to year; a minority of the population, with far too
much influence, harrying us at every turn on green issues and animal rights.
570

Jun 24th

Children Must Stay on Farms

Who in their right mind having grown up witnessing all that would want
to become a farmer? And yet these are the very people best placed to make
a success of farming in the future. Most of the problems I have mentioned
originate in bad government and can be overcome if the political will is there.
It has always been difficult for newcomers to get into farming but with the
current astronomical value of farmland and the lack of farms to rent, it is now
almost impossible to do what some farmers of my generation were fortunate
enough to do – start farming with very limited capital.
And the survival of the so-called small family farm is becoming increasingly
doubtful without considerable support from the tax payer, how ever much we
might wish otherwise. So there are really only two directions remaining for a
successful agricultural industry to take in the future – a continuation of family
farming businesses handed on from one generation to the next or a growth in
large farming empires owned and managed by city corporations or financial
institutions. I know which I would prefer.
It is surprising how large a proportion of the farms in Devon and Cornwall
are still in the hands of the younger generations of the same farming families
that were here when I started just after the war. If we are to maintain that
family connection through the coming years, we need to do something about it
now and not wait for events to push the word ’family’ out of farming altogether.
There is not a lot my generation can do about changing the political badmanagement that the industry has suffered in recent years - that is something
for the current leaders of our farming organisations to make a better job of than
we did. But what we oldies can do is to stop being pessimistic about the future,
as some of us often are, and talk up the industry, give the younger generation
more encouragement to stay in farming. Because there is every indication that
the next thirty or forty years are going to be exciting and rewarding times for
those who stick with it.
I would give my eye-teeth, if I had any left, to be able to begin my farming
career all over again now.

Weather Forecast Unreliable
July is upon us and with it the prospect of some much hotter weather to come.
June saw the first-cut silage wrapped and stacked and most of our hay safely
baled and under cover. We have two fields of hay left to make, but after some
very misleading predictions in June,I doubt if Jim will rely on the weather men
to tell him when to cut.
It is not that the forecasts are completely wrong – merely that the timing
is frequently out by 24 hours. And without a big-baler of our own, arranging
a time some days in advance for the contractor to come, can be a bit of a
lottery. Perhaps I am being unreasonable, but a guarantee of four or five five
days without rain does seem to be too much to hope for. Maybe this is one of
the consequences of global warming – fewer long spells of settled weather and
more frequent thundery outbreaks.
Since making sufficient good quality winter fodder as cheaply as possible
is vital to successful organic livestock farming, (buying-in feed becoming prohibitively expensive), these weather conditions could well be what we shall have
to get used to. In fact, so long as the thunder storms are not too extreme, they
could be to our advantage – vastly preferable to the hotter drier summers that
the met office has been predicting. The thought of a regular repeat of 1976,
when all our pastures turned to coconut matting is too horrible to contemplate.
You may deduce from this that I believe climate change is for real, however much the many letters to the press, citing unseasonably cold conditions
in different parts of the world, try to persuade us otherwise. Actually I still
have an open mind on the long term effects of greenhouse gas emissions. The
Met Office in Exeter can build a computer taking up the space of three concert
halls, as I understand it is doing in order to forecast accurately where severe
weather conditions will occur in the next forty years, but if it is unable to tell
us, a mere twenty miles away, on which days it is going to rain in the next
week, someone is obviously feeding the wrong information into the very large
computers currently in use.
In the short term, I have no doubt higher temperatures are here to stay, and
I don’t need the Met Office to tell me that. It is apparent in the northward
migration of Mediterranean and north African insect species that has been
occurring in recent years, putting pressure on our native species and causing
unfamiliar livestock diseases, such as bluetongue.
A possible reason for the dramatic decline on our farm of two of our commonest and most attractive butterflies, the Small Tortoiseshell and the Peacock,
572

Jul 8th

Porkers Deserve a Better Life

has really brought it home to me. There is no shortage of stinging nettles,their
food plant, so I had assumed it was warmer winters that were interfering with
their hibernation period. But the latest theory blames the migration from the
continent of a parasitic fly, which lays its eggs on stinging nettles, the resulting
maggots acting as predators and killing the caterpillars of our butterflies.
We are obviously going to have live with and adjust our farming accordingly
to contend with warmer weather for now. That should not be too difficult
– methods of hay and silage making, for instance, are very different to what
they were even twenty years ago. But I am not sure people are really serious
yet about combating the long term effects of global warming. There is still an
awful lot of talk but very little real action. We are jumping into our cars and
aeroplanes with complete abandon, and objecting to every form of renewable
energy if its construction is remotely visible from where we live. As in wartime,
we shall doubtless only take it seriously at the eleventh hour, when petrol is
rationed or reaches £5 a litre and electricity supplies are restricted to a few
hours a day.
And as usual in times of crisis, farming will be the first to have to react and
make major changes to the way we produce food. Whether we shall be making
hay and silage as we do today, or even if we are farming livestock when that
time comes, is very much an open question.

July 8th
Porkers Deserve a Better Life
Our customary summer visitors have arrived or, rather, been fetched by Jim in
the Land Rover. I am referring to the half a dozen weaned piglets that he is in
the habit of buying every year about now, in order to use up any corn remaining
in the corn-silo before the harvest overtakes us. Weaners are becoming harder
to locate and the choice of breed more restricted, but these are an attractive
little bunch, at present enjoying the run of one of the cattle yards.
Their ancestors must have hailed originally from Berkshire, but they come
from a farm not twenty miles away, and are obviously cross-bred, apparently
having some Gloucester Old Spot blood in them. If so, they should grow into
decent porkers, a popular cross a hundred years ago according to an old book I
have on pig breeding. They will soon be moving into an area of ancient Devon
woodland that Jim has prepared for them, where they can live happily enough
until late autumn, taking advantage of any acorns and beech mast that falls
their way. This is after all the natural habitat of pigs in the wild.
573

2009
Attempting to give farmed animals as natural an existence as possible on
welfare grounds during their often foreshortened lives is part of modern farming.
It used to be argued that contented animals were healthier, worked harder, grew
faster, produced better offspring and yielded more milk, eggs and wool. So there
was really no good reason for farmers to treat their animals badly.
Admittedly, in the past, animals were often confined in buildings which
were small, cramped with little light or ventilation. But at least the number of
animals on each farm was in proportion to the number of workers so that every
animal could receive individual attention, ensuring that they were kept clean
and properly fed.
Nowadays society demands more than that and is prepared to pass laws
giving animals the right to a quality of life bordering sometimes on humanising
their existence. Farmers are prepared to accept this, even welcome it, so long
as imported food conforms to the same regulations and does not put us out of
business.
The difficulty with providing this quality of life is mainly due to the increased
number of animals each farm worker is responsible for in order to keep prices
down in the shops.
To solve the problem, farmed animals no longer receive the individual attention they did in the past, but are increasingly managed in ways that allow
them to look after themselves. To do that successfully, we have to ensure they
can express their natural behaviour. Pigs, undoubtedly the most intelligent of
farm animals, require the most carefully designed systems of management to
allow them to achieve this.
I was revolted, therefore, to watch a documentary on TV last week depicting
the conditions in which pigs were being raised on farms in the US and Poland.
They belonged to the multinational Virginia-based company Smithfield Foods,
which processes nearly 30 million hogs into pork products each year – a 25 per
cent share of the market.
The pigs shown on the film were living in conditions that is the stuff of
nightmares. They were being kept in overcrowded numbers on bare concrete
floors covered in their own excrement. There appeared to be no regard whatever
to their comfort or cleanliness, about which pigs are very particular in the wild.
By the end of the programme, I had almost converted to vegetarianism. If
the film is a true reflection of the way pigs are farmed by Smithfield Foods,
it should be closed down immediately, if not in the US where we have little
influence, but certainly in Poland which is part of the European Union. And if
any of its products are being sold in our supermarkets, they should be sought

out, named and shamed. We owe it to our own pig industry to take a lead in
the matter.

July 15th
Concerns on Flood Plain Plan
Opposition to the latest proposals for new housing and industrial units at Crediton, our local market town, are hitting the headlines, and not for the first time.
The grounds for objecting to these plans are so overwhelming that you have to
wonder whether the developers really intend to build on the proposed sites, or
whether it is merely the opening gambit in a scheme to get new development
in less controversial places accepted by local people. The residents of Sandford and Upton Hellions, the two parishes adjacent to Crediton that will be
most affected by the proposals, certainly have my full support in their campaign to have them thrown out. Living eight miles away, the visual impact of
new buildings and the totally inadequate access for industrial vehicles will not
affect me so much, although anything that increases the traffic snarl-ups in or
around Crediton should be opposed without question. No, my main objection
to these proposals is something that affects all of us – the spread of urban sprawl
on to prime agricultural land in a flood plain. If we really are serious about
tackling global warming, surely this is the most crackbrained action we can
take. I thought Government policy actually outlawed building in a flood plain.
Whether we can expect heavier rain storms in the future is uncertain, but we
have always experienced rivers flooding from time to time, with the resulting
damage to property and occasional loss of life. Are the insurance companies,
therefore, rubbing their hands with glee at the thought of the huge premiums
they will be able to charge on the new properties? Or is it more likely they will
consider the whole project uninsurable? I have always understood that flood
plains acted as natural safety valves, allowing rivers in spate to spread out, slow
up and deposit their silt, thereby enriching the ground. In that sense, Crediton
is fortunate in being bounded on two sides by the flood plains of the Yeo to
the south and the Creedy to the east. Over the millennia, these rivers have
produced some of the most fertile farm land in the county. And so long as they
are not obstructed in any way, they could continue to do this in the years ahead.
Unfortunately, there has already been development in the Yeo flood plain in the
past and the planners seem intent on continuing the process. I remember there
was very bad flooding in the area when I first came to Devon, with people being
rescued in boats and properties damaged, our own doctor and the local police
sergeant receiving medals for bravery in ensuring there was no loss of life. We
575

now have a new Tesco Complex being built to add a further serious obstruction
to a river in flood, although we are assured that the flood prevention scheme
which was constructed all those years ago will be able to cope. Can we be sure
that allowance has been made for the extra rain that will be flushed straight
down the drains from the acres of new concrete, instead of soaking into the
ground? If floods in the future are greater than those we are accustomed to,
I can easily visualise Tesco floating away towards Exeter, and then, after the
horse has bolted, being told that the town needs a bigger and more expensive
prevention scheme immediately. I confess I have a vested interest in the Creedy
flood plain. Farming as we do in the head waters of the river, it is our soil which
has been washed down over time to make this such a valuable area on which
to grow food. And since only the best agricultural land will be able to increase
production easily in the future without using more of the limited fertiliser and
fuel required on less fertile ground, I would urge the authorities to think again
before going ahead with this ill-considered proposal.

Two-faced Claim on Badgers
Seeing we are only about nine miles as the crow flies south west of Tiverton, we
must be fairly close to, if not actually in, one of the areas earmarked by DEFRA
for the badger TB vaccination trials being set up this autumn. No doubt, we
shall find out in due course. If we are, I presume a ministry official will arrive
to persuade us to sign up to take part in the experiment.
Thankfully, it will be my son’s decision and not mine. I confess I have no
enthusiasm for catching badgers in wire cages, sticking needles in them, paint
marking them and releasing them to high-tail it over the hills to infect the
neighbouring parish. If that isn’t a recipe for perturbation, that pretentious
word (meaning ’disturbing’) used to mislead the public in the final report of the
Krebs Trial, I don’t know what is.
I realise that this Badger Vaccine Deployment Project, as it is so grandly
called, is only intended as a step towards an oral badger vaccine, but why
bother? Surely it would be better to wait for the oral version, which should be
ready long before the five years is up that this experiment is scheduled to last.
But for DEFRA to claim that there is no scientific basis to conclude there will
be a perturbation effect caused by catching badgers, mistreating and releasing
them, is frankly two-faced. That is precisely what was claimed by the Krebs
Trial as scientific proof that perturbation does occur if you cull badgers. All
576

Jul 22nd

Two-faced Claim on Badgers

it actually demonstrated was that culling in this way will disturb a family of
badgers if some of them are rattling around in cages outside their sett all night.
What Krebs did scientifically prove was that badgers can pass TB to cattle,
something that had been denied for years by the Badger Trusts and others. Up
to that time, the letters to the press were often dominated by people poohpoohing the possibility that badgers could be implicated in the spread of TB.
Thankfully that has now faded, only to be replaced by correspondence claiming
that culling badgers will cause more TB in cattle, which is also a false assumption. All it proves is that a badly operated cull, which Krebs undoubtedly was,
will in the short term increase the incidence of TB in cattle.
I have an underlying concern however that this latest ministry vaccination
trial is in a strange way proving the old saying that history tends to repeat
itself. The Krebs Trial was instigated by the last Tory government in 1996 as
an attempt to do something about the worrying increase in TB outbreaks in
cattle herds in Great Britain from 125 to 471 cases over the previous five years.
What wouldn’t we give to return to those figures today.
A year later, the Tories were swept aside by an incoming Labour government,
which gratefully latched onto Krebs since it included the proposal that no badger
culling licences would be permitted during the trial. This was allowed at that
time in severe herd TB breakdowns where nothing else worked, and has never
been resumed although the trial is long over.
Today we have a new trial being instigated, this time to test badger vaccination, which will doubtless prolong the refusal to issue culling licences. In
less than a year, a new Tory government will almost certainly oust Labour, and
once in power may well take the easy option of reneging on election promises
to tackle the TB reservoir in wildlife properly, and allow the vaccine trial as it
is set up to continue.
It is therefore up to us to ensure that the lessons of history are not ignored.
If it were my decision, no way should I agree to take part in this crackpot vaccine
trial, unless licences to cull badgers were permitted if the worst occurs and TB
outbreaks continue to escalate, with cattle slaughtered in greater numbers often
with inadequate compensation.
Nobody wishes to kill any animals, wild or farmed, unnecessarily, but it
is ironic that we can control the populations of any species involved in this
horror story, except badgers. And here we are, attempting to eliminate the
only natural population control in badgers – tuberculosis – without any back
up in the short term if the experiment fails.

Hopes for Harvesting Conditions
We enjoyed a cross-county coach ride to Dartmouth last Saturday, something
that I cannot recall ever doing before. We had been invited to a party celebrating the birthday of a long-time friend of ours with a river trip on the Dart.
There were enough guests to warrant hiring a coach, which allowed us to enjoy
a view of the Devon farmland as seen from above the high-banked hedges that
shield virtually every road.
Coach travel for us is normally reserved for journeys outside Devon, generally
on motorways from which the view is distant but uninterrupted. I get a lot of
pleasure admiring my adopted county during the summer months, but always
from a car. On this occasion we were seeing it just as a traveller on horseback
would have seen it in medieval times and what an incredibly lush countryside
for late July it looks to be this year. Considering the amount of rain we have
had recently, that is hardly surprising, but typically, like farmers everywhere,
we are beginning to worry about the weather continuing unsettled as we move
into the harvest.
We have some late hay and second cut silage to make, two fields of spring
oats to harvest and some standing straw, which Jim bought at auction, to bale
following the combine. So a dry autumn would be most welcome.
What we do not want is another harvest like last year, when wet weather
delayed combining, yields were correspondingly reduced and the corn so damp
it needed expensive treatment to store. Not only that, the straw was a disaster,
both our own and the straw Jim bought later in the winter. The latter had
obviously been baled wet and was virtually impossible to shake out properly for
the cattle to lie on. And that situation was repeated across the country.
At least we now have the ability with modern machinery to make some
sort of a fist of gathering the crops whatever the conditions. But although
we end up with increased costs, reduced production, and something to whinge
about, I doubt if urban shoppers notice anything amiss – the price of food
in the supermarkets hardly varies. They would certainly have been concerned
two hundred years ago, when the price of bread would have risen alarmingly.
Harvest prospects must have been an important topic of conversation in those
days.
By the 1870s, bad harvests, and there were some absolute shockers at the
time, were being balanced by cheap imports which often actually drove prices
to hard-pressed farmers down even further. And apart from war years, that
state of affairs has continued to this day, with successive governments fiddling
578

Aug 19th

with various support mechanisms and financial inducements to keep farmers
in business. I often wonder what the Devonshire countryside would look like
now if there had been no attempt after the last war to increase agricultural
production, no guaranteed prices or food subsidies, no preferential estate duty
or exemption from local rates, and farmers left entirely to their own devices.
We shall never know, and it is probably pointless to speculate, but it was
certainly advocated from time to time by some politicians, and would probably
have been welcomed by Prime Ministers like Heath and Thatcher. It has even
been suggested that, with land values and the price of animal feeding-stuffs
falling to their proper economic level, smaller family farms might have had a
better chance of surviving, and the drift of labour from the countryside slowed.
Large arable farmers would certainly have had a much harder time of it.
If good or bad harvests make little difference to the price of food in the shops
these days, why do the wildly fluctuating prices we receive for our produce also
have no discernible effect on what is charged by the supermarkets? The price
we are currently getting for our finished beef cattle has dropped by over 20 per
cent in the last twelve months, and even more extreme, the price of lamb has
fallen by over thirty per cent in the last six weeks. Farmers are fully aware of
the effect of supply and demand – it has always been a major part of running
a farm, but the housewife never seems to benefit from these price changes. Is
it because the value of what we produce is such a small proportion of the retail
sale value, or are the supermarkets merely happy to rake in the extra cash?

August 19th
Beatrix Would Be Shocked
A few days away from the farm and I realise how lucky we are to live where
we do. Not that the Lake District is exactly drab and uninteresting, but the
sheer mass of people swarming in the towns and tourist honey pots make this
a bad time of year to choose for a visit. A family wedding had the Pettyfers
gathering from all over, and following this we took the opportunity for a brief
holiday with my Canadian brother and sister-in-law, motoring up through the
Welsh borders to the Lake District, somewhere they had never before visited.
Jenny and I have explored the Lakes on two or three occasions in the past,
generally as a stopping off point on our way to the Scottish highlands, our
favourite holiday destination. But this time I was immediately struck by the
absence of sheep on the higher slopes. They were there, but only in very reduced
numbers, with the majority grazing the valley pastures, which I have always
assumed are normally held back for bad winter weather or lambing time.
579

2009
What was even more noticeable was the huge upsurge in the growth of
bracken on the lower slopes of the hillsides, presumably caused by this lack of
grazing animals. I know that the vegetation of all our uplands is degenerating
through a decline in the fortunes of hill farmers, but it has never struck me
so forcibly before. I spoke to a farmer who was shearing a few sheep in a pen
beside the road, and he confirmed my worst fears that the situation was the
same all over Cumbria.
What Beatrix Potter, who I always think of as the inspiration and conscience
of the Lake District, would make of it, had she been alive, I cannot imagine?
Her Peter Rabbit books, written one hundred years ago and set in the area,
made her a household name all over the world. They also made her a fortune
which allowed her to purchase large tracts of the Lake District, but she was far
more than a writer of children’s books.
As a young woman, she was a recognised naturalist and expert on fungi,
and a friend of Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley, the founder of the National Trust.
Later, she settled in the Lake District near Hawkshead and was for thirty years
a well respected sheep farmer, a President of the Herdwick Sheep Breeders
Association, and owner of 14 farms and 4000 acres of land, which she left to
the National Trust to help protect the beauty of the Lake district as she had
known it.
Obviously this is no longer happening and not only in Cumbria. Layland
Branfield, who farms on Dartmoor, tells me that the current government policy
for dealing with the vegetation which is overwhelming our upland National
Parks, due to an enforced reduction in cattle and sheep numbers in these areas,
is to mechanically cut or burn the offending growth of bracken and gorse. What
an extraordinarily carbon-friendly way of solving the problem?
Surely it is not beyond the wit of DEFRA and Natural England to get
together with the farmers in these areas to devise a scheme which will encourage
the correct stocking rate for our hills to control the vegetation. This would allow
the production of more beef and lamb in a natural and environmentally friendly
way, something that Hilary Benn, the DEFRA Secretary, is now on record as
wishing on the whole farming industry.
Hopefully, the urban millions, who use these uplands as a breathing space
away from the congestion of city life, will rise up in the spirit of Beatrix Potter
and demand action rather than words from our political masters - and sooner
rather than later, since the longer the current policy continues the more difficult
it becomes to reverse the situation.
As an aside to these comments, I discovered something on our recent trip
that has long puzzled me. One of Beatrix Potter’s books, The Tale of Timmy

Bovine TB and FCN Report

Tiptoes, was about grey squirrels, a species that did not exist in the Lake
District, where she did the illustrations in 1911 when she wrote it. She also
includes chipmunks and a black bear in the story. Apparently her American
public asked her publishers to persuade her to write a book about their animals.
Obviously Beatrix Potter was not above an eye to the main chance if it earned
more money towards the preservation of her beloved countryside.

August 26th
Bovine TB and FCN Report
If anyone has any doubts about the effect bovine TB is having on farmers here
in the South West, they should get a copy of “Stress and Loss”, a report that
has been produced by the charity, Farm Crisis Network. As last Wednesday’s
editorial in the Western Morning News makes clear, it is a penetrating report of
the financial hardship, psychological distress and physical illness among farmers and their families caused by the disease, which has been allowed to run
unchecked with over 40,000 cattle now being slaughtered annually. Over the
last twelve years under this government, bovine TB has grown to become a
more serious cattle plague than the Foot and Mouth outbreak of 2001, and yet
it gets surprisingly little coverage in the national press.
The Western Morning News went on to urge the Secretary of State, Hilary
Benn, to read this report, which he received on a recent visit to the Westcountry,
and rethink his refusal to allow any control of badgers, the principal wildlife
reservoir of the disease. However, I am afraid it will have no more effect on
Benn than water off a duck’s back. He may be a kind and compassionate man
in private life, but like all feeble politicians, he will stick rigidly to his decision
for fear of showing signs of weakness. And is he likely to risk the wrath of the
badger lobby when he is within a few months of a General Election?
Before the Krebs Trial into badger culling, herd owners could apply to DEFRA for a licence under the 1992 Badgers Act, to slaughter the badgers on
their farm where the persistent recurrence of bTB could not be attributed to
cattle movements. Nothing irritates me more than the letter-writing supporters
of the Badger Trust, who keep referring to the misconception that bovine TB
was brought under control in the ’60s and ’70s without having to kill badgers.
This is simply untrue – DEFRA’s Animal Health Division records from those
years must still exist showing which farms could not be cleared without at the
same time taking out this secondary wildlife reservoir. The Badger Trust must
be well aware of this, but it does nothing to set the record straight.
581

2009
The Krebs Trial put a temporary hold on licences, to avoid interfering with
the evidence, but DEFRA has never allowed a return to the issuing of licences to
clear the badgers in these extreme cases, presumably under instructions from
the Secretary of State. This has never been ratified by Parliament, and the
minister is clearly acting outside the law. The farmers affected by this decision
have therefore been denied the right to care for their animals on their own farms,
which the Badgers Act specifically permits. The Ministry vets are strangely
silent on the subject and one has to assume that they have been threatened
with possible dismissal.
What did the opposition MPs do at the time to bring this to the attention
of the Commons? And what did the NFU do to challenge DEFRA’s right to
withhold licences from individual farmers where the veterinary advise clearly
showed that there was no other way of preventing their cattle from contracting
bovine TB? I joined with others at NFU meetings where the President was
present, to demand that action be taken to support these farmers and I privately
urged NFU Council members to persuade the Union to take legal advice to allow
licensing to be resumed.
And the answer always came back the same. By so doing, we were in danger
of precipitating the Badger Trust into taking out an injunction to prevent the
issuing of licences, thereby delaying a resolution of an intolerable situation.
Well, after all this time since the Krebs Trial ended, ’delay’ seems a strange
excuse for inaction and I am of the opinion that the NFU does bear responsibility
for failing some of our members and should admit it openly.
The NFU County Chairmen in the South West should advise the worst
affected farmers to take the only sanction left to them and cancel their subscriptions. I had no difficulty in giving precisely that advice to small farmers
during my year as Devon County Chairman, when I felt they were being badly
let down. Perhaps that would persuade the President, Peter Kendall, to do
more to bring this current disgraceful situation to the attention of the public.
