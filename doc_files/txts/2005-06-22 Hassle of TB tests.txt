22nd Jun ’05

Monday morning and an early start rounding up the cattle for our all-important 60-day TB re-test. You may remember that we had our first ever TB reactors a couple of months ago, following which one heifer was slaughtered and three animals were left in isolation pending the post-mortem result. So far that has proved negative, so Thursday will be the day of judgement when the vet returns and we get all the cattle in again to check for any reaction to the tuberculin jabs. We could do without this hassle at the moment - with fine weather, Jim is back to haymaking.

On a brighter note, Bev seems to be having a good year with the ewe flock. Shearing was quickly done on a cool calm evening, without the mini-hurricane we had to contend with a year ago, and half the lambs have already gone for slaughter at a price that is 10% up on last year. That at least replaces the ewe subsidy that is now a distant memory. The lambs are grading well and averaging 20 kilos off just mothers milk and grass at about 14 weeks old, without worm drenches or vaccines, which is pretty satisfactory. Not that anything will change next year now that we are officially organic, so long as the spring grass grows as well without the small dressing of nitrogen fertilizer that we have always used. We can start selling lambs as organic after May 2007, but if they take longer to fatten, they may not taste as sweet. 

Unfortunately, unlike lamb, beef prices do not seem to have risen. We sent four heifers off for slaughter last week; they weighed and graded well but we shall receive almost exactly the same price from the abattoir as we got for similar heifers last June. As any additional slaughter premium on them has now ceased, they will end up making £50 a head less. There was very little profit in sucklers even with production subsidies, so unless the trade is prepared to raise the price, the future for cattle farming here doesn’t look very rosy. TB may well be the final straw. That makes little sense in a region ideally suited to beef production in a Europe that is currently importing beef from all over the world to make up a shortfall.

What makes the present situation even more bizarre is something Jim was told following a recent visit to his arable-farming cousins in Hertfordshire. Apparently they are selling their feed-wheat at the dismal price of  £65 a tonne for export to beef feedlots in Western Australia. Admittedly it is being transported partly as ballast, but some of the resulting beef is no doubt returning back here. If that isn’t food miles, I don’t know what is.

None of this is really surprising when you hear Blair arguing with Chirac over Britain’s budget rebate. I am all for him trying to give the French President a bloody nose, but I would prefer it if our own Prime Minister at least understood after all these years how the CAP operated. To suggest that there is any connection between our rebate, which I thought originally derived from the level of our VAT returns relative to the rest of Europe, and an agricultural policy that is supposedly applied equally to all member states, is, to use Chirac’s word, pathetic. Of course French farming gets twice as much as we do – it’s area of farmland is double ours. The individual farmers get exactly the same, depending on the size of their farms. Or at least they should do, depending on how much support they get from the coffers of their own governments, which is perhaps where the French do rather well.

Isn’t Blair aware that the present CAP has already been reformed in 2003, with the UK’s full agreement, or didn’t his secretary of state, Margaret Beckett, bother to explain it to him? This will last until 2013, with the EU’s agriculture budget reduced during that time by 15% of the commission’s original proposal. How much further does he want to damage Europe’s food producing ability in the light of his determination to bring the subject of global warming to the top of the agenda at the forthcoming G8 summit? He may well see farmers as an unimportant 5% of Europe’s population, but they will certainly be needed when the first effects of global warming become apparent – a shortage of food worldwide.
