Prominent Westcountry farming figure Ian Pettyfer is the latest member of the WMN farming team. Mr Pettyfer, who is in his early 70s, helps run a mixed, 300-acre family farm at South Emlett, Morchard Bishop, north of Crediton. After leaving school in 1947 he worked on a farm in surrey before going to Cambridge to read Agriculture in 1948. Arriving in Devon in 1951, he bought South Emlett in partnership with John Thurley, a fellow graduate. He bought out John's share in 1954, and married Jenny a neighbouring farmer's daughter. They have three children - Cath, Jim and Mel. Mr Pettyfer milked Guernsey cows until the mid-1980s, and became closely involved with Quality Milk Producers Ltd, the Jersey and Guernsey farmers' co-operative responsible for marketing and promoting CI and Gold Top milk nationally. He believes his past tenure as NFU Devon chairman was intended by his fellow farmers as "a penance for not keeping my mouth shut". He added: "We now farm with a herd of suckler cows and a  flock of early lambing sheep. Jim and Bev run the farm, and Jenny and I, although we still live on the farm, take a back seat. This involves doing some of the more tedious, but financially necessary, form filling, and checking the cattle. It also gives me time to take more interest in the farm's wildlife."
